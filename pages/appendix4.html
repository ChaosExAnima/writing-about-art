							>APPENDIX III:  Sample student papers (visual

						>
					</h3>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>
						The CCNY students who wrote these papers were given a
						variation of the assignment below.  In all cases, they
						were told to go to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and
						select one work on display in the galleries of modern
						art. The first version of the paper is what the students
						actually handed in, which did not necessarily receive an
						A, but showed a basically strong organization and
						mentioned the most important visual qualities.  The
						second version has been edited by me for this book,
						underlining the topic sentences, correcting the grammar,
						adding significant details that were missing, and making
						the wording a little more graceful and a little less
						repetitious. I have tried to stay as close to the
						original texts as possible.  Note that the papers could
						have been revised in many different ways.  There is no
						one answer to an assignment like this, just something
						that succeeds more or less well for the reader.
					</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p><strong class="mod">THE  ASSIGNMENT</strong>:</p>
					<p>
						Write a two-page visual description of the work you
						selected.  NO RESEARCH.  Include the name of the artist,
						the title, the date, the medium, the approximate
						dimensions, the name of the collection, and the museum
						number.  Be sure to give enough details for the reader
						to be able to visualize the work in all its important
						aspects.  Paragraphs should be the basic unit of
						organization.  Check your topic sentences, grammar, and
						spelling.  To find out how effective your description
						is, draw a picture of what you have written or have
						someone else read it.  Revise, revise, revise.

					<div class="mod">
						<p>ORIGINAL PAPER:</p>
						<p>“<em>From Green to White</em>, by Yves Tanguy”</p>
						<p class="mod">
							<em>From Green to White</em> (Metropolitan Museum of
							Art, 1999.363.82) is a surrealistic painting by Yves
							Tanguy in 1954.  In the lower part of the painting,
							what appears to be an strange city, or part of some
							device.  The rest of <em>From Green to White</em> is
							covered in a strange, organic-looking background,
							with any shadow washed out by fog or some
							omni-present light.  In contrast, the city is
							naturalistically shaded, creating even greater
							contrast to the barren fog occupying the upper three
							fourths of the painting.  The fog is not completely
							featureless, however.  The lower part of it is
							darkened, interspersed with streaks of color.  Past
							the dark area is a section of white with a slightly
							blue tinge, with streaks of bright white.  The
							streaks gives the impression of being shimmers of
							light, giving the whole section a look similar to a
							block of partly melted ice.  The ice quickly fades
							out the blue, leaving what appears to besky.
						</p>
						<p class="mod">
							The city itself has a certain organic look to it. 
							The buildings are all rounded, with the roofs each
							at different slopes.  In general the city is simple
							shapes, distorted yet still recognizable. There are
							a few buildings that stand out in the painting.  One
							building in the middle, with a blue roof and curved
							outer walls, has strange waves on the roof, and
							shapes cut out from the walls.  Another building, to
							the left of the blue-roofed one, has grey-green
							tubing coming from the shaft of the tower.  The top
							of the tower has window-like openings going around
							its circumference.
						</p>
						<p class="mod">
							What Tanguy meant this painting to represent is
							unknown.  The title,
							<span style="text-decoration: underline"
								>From Green to White</span
							>, gives us no hint of what Tanguy meant by this, if
							he meant anything at all.  One possible idea is that
							the city represents human innovation or
							civilization.  This is surrounded by a vast empty
							gulf of nothingness, representing our potential for
							growth.  An alternative interpretation is that the
							void is a barrier, restricting our growth beyond a
							certain point.  This barrier is represented by the
							section of the void that has the appearance of
							melted ice.  Beyond the wall is the sky,
							representing freedom.  We, however, are trapped on
							the swamp-like surface, slowly expanding our
							city–until we reach this barrier.

					<p><strong>REVISION OF PAPER #1:</strong></p>

					<p>
						<span class="mod"
							>1.<strong>  </strong>Read the paper all the way
							through, underlining the first or topic sentence of
							each paragraph.  (This will be easiest to do if you
							print out a copy from www.writingaboutart.org.) 
							These sentences should form an outline of the
							paper.  Do they?  Do you know what the work looks
							like from this description?  Do you know all of its
							qualities as a physical object - medium, size,
							colors, surface texture?  Which elements are
							missing?</span
						>
					</p>

					<p>
						2.  Find a reproduction of the painting online (Google
						the name of the artist and the title) so you know what
						it actually looks like.  Is this what you imagined?  Why
						not?  In fact, this painting is extremely difficult to
						describe because it is very precise in its description
						of unrecognizable objects.  If you have a choice, select
						a topic you can write about easily!
					</p>

					<p>
						3.  Now go back to the paper, and begin going through it
						sentence by sentence.  First check for mistakes in
						spelling, grammar, and word usage.  Then consider
						whether words have been used effectively to make the
						meaning clear.  The first sentence is especially
						important because it tells the reader what the paper
						will be about.

						before &quot;what appears to be.&quot;
					</p>

					<p>
						<span style="text-decoration: underline">Comments</span
						>:  The &quot;lower part&quot; is only meaningful if we
						can visualize the work as a whole, and it doesn't
						indicate exactly how much of the composition it fills. 
						The order of the information can be reversed to get rid
						of the passive &quot;there is.&quot;  The phrase
						&quot;part of some device&quot; is too vague to mean
						anything.  The more specific a description is the
						better.  Since the most tangible phrase connected to
						this area of the picture is &quot;appears to be a
						strange city,&quot; that can be kept, although it would
						be better to know a little more about what it looks like
						so the reader can judge the ways in which it is and
						isn't like a city.  Furthermore, we still do not know
						the picture's size, orientation, subject, or how it was
						painted.  That information must be added.
					</p>

					<p>
						<span style="text-decoration: underline"
							>Final revision</span
						>:  A vertical composition of about 39 x 32 inches, the
						work depicts an imaginary place.  Tanguy used tiny,
						barely visible brushstrokes, so that the surface of the
						painting is almost perfectly smooth.  What appears to be
						a strange city fills the bottom fourth of the canvas. 
					</p>

					<p>
						<span style="text-decoration: underline"
							>Original third sentence</span
						>:  The rest of <em>From Green to White</em> is covered
						in a strange, organic-looking background, with any
						shadow washed out by fog or some omnipresent light. 
					</p>

					<p>
						<span style="text-decoration: underline">Comments</span
						>:  Something can't be covered with a background,
						&quot;organic-looking&quot; is too vague to evoke
						anything specific in the mind of the reader, the absence
						of shadow comes as a surprise since its presence has not
						been mentioned, and how can something be both a
						&quot;fog&quot; and an &quot;omnipresent light&quot;? 
						Although the topic - the rest of the picture - is what
						should come next, the information must be much more
						specific.  Looking at the picture again suggests
						&quot;sky&quot; as another way to describe this area,
						which fits with the idea of organic shapes (like clouds,
						for example), fog, and a pervasive light.
						 &quot;Background&quot; suggests that the picture
						contains an illusion of three-dimensional space.  It is
						important not to confuse the two-dimensional or flat
						design of a picture with a three-dimensional or spatial
						organization.  The first is described by the words top,
						middle, and bottom, while the second by front, middle,
						and back.  Since it is confusing for the reader to
						switch between different frames of reference, and no
						indication of a spatial structure has been given, it is
						better to stay with the two-dimensional reference
						already used (&quot;lower part,&quot; &quot;bottom
						fifth&quot;).

					</p>

					<p>
						<span style="text-decoration: underline">Comments</span
						>:  Something that appears to be a strange city has been
						transformed into a city with naturalistic shading.  This
						would make more sense if the reader knew the ways in
						which it does and doesn't look like a city. 
						Furthermore, the information about shading would be more
						useful if it was explained where it appears.  Notice
						that relative dimension is now given with &quot;the
						upper three-fourths of the painting.&quot;  Information
						like this, pertaining to the entire composition, should
						be given as early as possible.  If the relative size of
						the first area had been given as the bottom quarter - or
						fifth, which seems more accurate - it would have
						established the proportions of the two major areas of
						the composition.

					<p>
						<span style="text-decoration: underline">Comments</span
						>:  First, there is no need to contradict a statement
						that has not been made, so the fifth sentence is not
						necessary.  &quot;Lower part&quot; is vague, and the
						phrase has been used to refer to two different areas of
						the painting (in the second sentence and in this one),
						which is confusing to the reader.  Rather than
						&quot;lower part,&quot; &quot;darkened,&quot; and
						&quot;streaks of color,&quot; be specific about the
						shapes and colors. 
					</p>

					<p>
						<span style="text-decoration: underline"

					<p>
						<span style="text-decoration: underline"
							>Original seventh sentence</span
						>:  Past the dark area is a section of white with a
						slightly blue tinge, with streaks of bright white.
					</p>

					<p>
						<span style="text-decoration: underline">Comments</span
						>:  &quot;Past&quot; suggests placement in terms of
						three-dimensional space.  Since &quot;lower part&quot; 
						locates the area in terms of two-  rather than
						three-dimensional design, it's better to be consistent
						and use &quot;above.&quot;  Furthermore, the
						relationship between the &quot;streaks of bright
						white&quot; and the &quot;section of white&quot; has to
						be made clear.  Since the &quot;streaks&quot; are
						described more fully in the next sentence, they can be
						removed from this one.  Finally, since the previous
						sentence used &quot;section,&quot; the word here should
						be changed to another one, like &quot;area.&quot;
					</p>

					<p>
						<span style="text-decoration: underline">Grammar</span
						>:  &quot;Streaks&quot; is plural, so the verb should be

					<p>
						<span style="text-decoration: underline">Comments</span
						>:  The fact that they are &quot;bright white,&quot;
						eliminated from the previous sentence, must be added. 
						Both &quot;shimmers of light&quot; and &quot;partly
						melted ice&quot; are images, and it should be made clear
						that they are alternative descriptions for the same

					</p>

					<p>
						<span style="text-decoration: underline"

						<p>REVISED PAPER:</p>
						<p class="mod">
							This paper will be a visual description of
							<em>From Green to White </em>(Metropolitan Museum of
							Art, 1999.363.82)<em>, </em>an oil painting made by
							the Surrealist artist Yves Tanguy in 1954.  A
							vertical composition of about 39 x 32 inches, the
							picture describes an imaginary place using tiny,
							barely visible brushstrokes, so that the surface of
							the painting is almost perfectly smooth.  What
							appears to be a strange city, naturalistically
							shaded to suggest space, fills the bottom fifth of
							the composition.  The rest of
							<em>From Green to White </em>looks like sky.  The
							lower part of this section contains dark, wavy,
							horizontal bands, interspersed with streaks of red,
							pink, green, and blue.  Above that is an area of
							white, tinged slightly blue.  Streaks of bright
							white within it give the impression of being
							shimmers of light, or reflections from a block of
							partly melted ice.  These streaks fade out about
							halfway up the picture, leaving what appears to be a
							blue sky with a few wispy white clouds in it.
						</p>
						<p class="mod">
							The strange city at the bottom of the composition
							consists of many rounded shapes that suggest oddly
							proportioned structures made out of grey rock.  The
							simplest are cut-off cylinders.  One at the left
							edge of the picture is the tallest element.  A flat
							low form in the middle, which extends across nearly
							a third of the width of the picture, has a blue roof
							with what look like strange waves and a single
							orange oval on it.  These are the only things that
							are not some kind of grey color.  To the left of
							this structure is a tower with grey-green vertical
							tubes along its sides.  Window-like openings go
							around it.  To the right is the largest structure of
							them all, like a ziggurat made of three circular
							flat-topped tiers.  Between it and the blue roofed
							form are 8-10 tall, dark, flat spires.  A thin grey

					<div class="mod">
						<p>ORIGINAL PAPER:      </p>
						<p class="mod">
							For my analysis, I chose a painting by Emil Nolde,
							<span style="text-decoration: underline"
								>Large Sunflowers 1. </span
							>  This piece is rather large, about a yard in each
							direction and is encased in a gold frame.  The
							medium is oil paint on a wood base.  The paint is
							thick, wet on wet, using a big brush.
						</p>
						<p class="mod">
							The composition is of eight sunflowers, some of them
							cropped, allowing us a partial view of their
							blooms.   The colors of the flowers range from
							yellow, yellow-orange, light red, to dark red.  All
							but one of the yellow toned flowers have deep brown
							centers.  The artist used deep reds and browns to
							represent the centers of the red toned flowers.
							Their size range from about the size of a melon to
							the size of an orange.  They are surrounded by large
							green leaves and stalks, suggesting a bush.  The
							painting is of an outdoor space.  Through the
							pockets of leaves, there are hints of dark blues and
							greens, suggesting shadow and depth, possibly a
							large garden or field.  Towards the bottom of the
							painting, there are dashes of red visible through
							the leaves, alluding to more sunflowers in the depth
							of the bush.  The sunflowers and leaves take up most
							of the composition, except for a few inches on the
							top of the painting.  This space is a horizon line,
							an awesome sunset using reds, oranges, yellows, and
							browns; with an orb of the deepest red and orange
							depicting the sun itself. 
						</p>
						<p class="mod">
							The focal point of this composition is the biggest
							sunflower, in the center/left side and a pocket of
							leaves in the center itself.  The flower is deep
							yellow with a muddy, yellow-brown center.  Some of
							the petals are bending, possibly wilting or swaying
							in the wind.  It has a bright green stalk, with a
							yellow streak of paint through it.  The leaves in
							the center are a bright green with hints of blue,
							whereas the other leaves in the painting are a
							deeper green, about the color of an actual sunflower
							leaf.  The brush stroke is also different than the
							other leaves in the painting.  The center leaves are
							painting with a wavy, lyrical stroke.  The painter
							used the same size brush with the other leaves, but
							a shorter, straighter stroke.   
						</p>
						<p class="mod">
							As I previously mentioned, this piece was painted
							using a wet on wet technique.  The painter applied
							color on top of color, while all were still wet.  He
							used the base colors to blend new colors on the
							canvas, instead of on a palette.  I believe he also
							used some type of liquin base to enhance the wet
							look.  By painting wet on wet, the artist not only
							blends colors, but edges also bleed into each other,
							creating a very loose, painterly composition.  The
							entire painting is thick, accentuated by many
							especially gloppy areas.
						</p>
						<p class="mod">
							The painter used a very large brush throughout the
							painting, with various brush strokes.  He used long,
							continuous strokes to depict the stalks, for
							example.  He also used short strokes, cross weaves,
							and waves.  All appeared to be applied with a loose,
							relaxed hand.   
						</p>
						<p class="mod">
							All of the aforementioned elements, create an image
							of nature and tranquility.  The use of a wood base,
							instead of typical weaved canvas, accents the ties
							to the natural world that are seen throughout this
							piece.  The colors are warm, and the piece is fluid
							and flowing.  Nolde used wet paint and a loose hand
							to capture a feeling of relaxation and an image of
							unprocessed beauty.

						discuss the composition of the subject (sunflowers), the
						most important part visually of the composition, the
						technique, the brush and brush strokes, and a sense of
						its meaning or emotional mood.  Although it would seem
						that the discussion of brushes and brush strokes should
						come before the technique, the topics in and of

						>:  &quot;Analysis&quot; is not as precise a description
						of the paper as it could be, because it doesn't answer
						the question of what kind of analysis it will be. 
						&quot;Painting&quot; can be made more specific by adding
						the information from the third sentence.  Many art
						historians object to describing art as a
						&quot;piece&quot; because it seems too casual and,
						perhaps, commercial.  There are lots of other
						possibilities, such as &quot;work&quot; and
						&quot;object.&quot;  &quot;Rather large&quot; is vague,
						and unnecessary when it is followed by actual
						dimensions. The measurement given, however, suggests
						that canvas is a square, which it is not.  This has to
						be changed.  Unless the gold frame is going to be
						mentioned again, it should be eliminated because it is
						not part of Nolde's painting.  &quot;Wet on wet&quot; is
						a specific technique of painting that should be
						explained, and its relation to the paint explained. The
						description &quot;big brush&quot; is vague.  Solving
						each of those problems produces something like this:

							The painter used a very large brush throughout the
							painting, with various brush strokes.  He used long,

						>:  Distinguishing between the brush used and the
						various types of brush strokes made with it is a good
						idea.  “Very large” is vague, however – compared to
						what?  Substitute a more precise measurement.  In
						addition, these two paragraphs raise similar issues, so
						perhaps the information can be better organized.  The
						subjects can be defined as the brush (apparently a
						single “very large” one), the handling of the brush,
						including strokes (“long, continuous,” “short,” “cross
						weaves,” “waves”) and the more general “applied with a
						loose, relaxed hand,” which perhaps relates to the
						&quot;very loose, painterly composition.&quot;  Other
						terms relating to specific techniques of paint
						application include &quot;wet-on-wet,&quot; with its
						blended edges, &quot;thick&quot; paint, and &quot;many
						especially gloppy areas.&quot;  Finally, there is the
						character of the color, mixed on the canvas instead of a
						palette.  “Liquin base,” which most readers probably
						would take to be a typing mistake for “liquid base,”
						actually is a technical term referring to a particular
						kind of medium for paint, which enhances drying time and
						increases glossiness.  Unless you know that your
						audience will understand such specific technical terms,
						it is better to avoid them.  One way to reorganize this
						information is:

							applied in different ways.  Long, continuous strokes
							appear in some of the stalks, for example, while the

							weaves, and waves.  In many places, the paint was
							applied thickly and wet on wet, color on top of

						obvious - a picture of sunflowers certainly is an
						&quot;image of nature&quot; - and contradictory -
						intensely colored, thickly painted sunflowers in front
						of a brilliant sunset doesn't seem likely to create an
						image of tranquility.  The point about the wooden base
						is not relevant if this is information given by the
						museum label instead of something that can be seen, and
						the paper contains no evidence that it is visually
						apparent.  The rest of the characterization reads like
						something thrown together to end a paper.  The colors
						are warm (although the comment wasn't made above), but
						that has nothing to do with nature or tranquility. 
						Surely it isn't the work itself, but the composition
						that is &quot;fluid and flowing&quot; (although that
						wasn't exactly said above either).  Of course Nolde used
						wet paint - any painter has to! - but neither that nor
						the &quot;loose hand&quot; lead to a &quot;feeling of
						relaxation,&quot; at least without explanation. 
						Finally, all the ways in which this painting has been
						constructed demonstrates that it is not at all &quot;an
						image of unprocessed beauty.&quot;  All of this can be
						reduced to one sentence.

						<p>REVISED PAPER:</p>
						<p class="mod">
							For my visual description, I chose to write about an
							oil painting on wood by Emil Nolde,
							<span style="text-decoration: underline"
								>Large Sunflowers I</span
							>, in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of
							Art (2002.386).  The work, which is about two and a
							half feet high and three feet wide, shows eight
							sunflowers with their leaves, seen from close up. 
							Some of them are cropped by the edges of the canvas,
							so we have only a partial view of their blooms. 
							They vary from about the size of a cantaloupe melon
							to about the size of an orange, which might be the
							actual dimensions of these flowers.  The colors
							range from yellow, yellow-orange, and light red, to
							dark red.  All but one of the yellow-toned flowers
							have deep brown centers, while the red ones have
							deep reds and browns at their centers. The
							sunflowers are surrounded by large green leaves and
							stalks.  The brilliantly colored paint is thick, and
							has been applied in big, visible brush strokes.
						</p>
						<p class="mod">
							The sunflowers and leaves take up most of the
							composition, but there are indications of an outdoor
							space around them.  A strip a few inches high at the
							top of the painting forms a horizon line, filled
							with an awesome sunset of reds, oranges, yellows,
							and browns.  An orb of the deepest red and orange
							toward the center depicts the sun itself.  Between
							the leaves, hints of dark blues and greens suggest
							shadow and depth, possibly in a large garden or
							field.  Towards the bottom of the painting, dashes
							of red suggest more sunflowers behind the ones we
							see. 
						</p>
						<p class="mod">
							The focal points of this composition are the biggest
							sunflower, to the left of center, and a pocket of
							leaves in the center itself.  The flower is deep
							yellow with a muddy, yellow-brown center.  Some of
							its petals are bending, possibly wilting or swaying
							in a wind.  It has a bright green stalk, with a
							streak of yellow paint through it.  The leaves in
							the center are a bright green with hints of blue,
							whereas the other leaves in the painting are a
							deeper green, more like the color of an actual
							sunflower leaf.  They also are distinguished by the
							wavy brush stroke that appears here, which is
							different from the shorter, straighter stroke used
							for the other leaves in the painting.
						</p>
						<p class="mod">
							The artist seems to have used the same large brush
							throughout the picture, although the paint was
							applied in different ways.  Long, continuous strokes
							appear in some of the stalks, for example, while the
							flowers have been made with short strokes, cross
							weaves, and waves.  In many places, the paint was
							applied thickly and wet on wet, color on top of
							color before any of it had dried.  The result is
							that the edges of the strokes bleed into each

					<p><strong>THREE-DIMENSIONAL WORKS:</strong></p>

					<p>
						Works of art that occupy space instead of being flat
						present additional elements to describe.  In addition to
						size, medium, and subject, the writer must indicate what
						it looks like from different points of view and how it
						engages the space around it.  The shape may be
						complicated to describe, especially if it does not
						correspond to a representation of the natural world.  A
						sample paper follows.  Treat it exactly like the ones
						above.  Underline the topic sentences and see if they
						make sense and if the order seems logical.  Look at the
						first sentence and see if it tells the reader what the
						paper will be about.  Then look at the organization of
						each paragraph and see if it makes sense.  Each sentence
						should lead logically to the next one, and they all
						should be about the topic introduced in the first
						sentence of the paragraph.  Can you draw the work?  Do
						certain parts of the paper seem more successful than
						others?  Why?

					<p><strong>SAMPLE VISUAL DESCRIPTION #3</strong></p>

					<div class="mod">
						<p>FINAL PAPER:</p>
						<p class="mod">
							Auguste Rodin created
							<em>The Burgers of Calais</em> (Metropolitan Museum
							of Art, 1989.407) between 1885 and 1897.  The bronze
							sculpture consists of six life-size male figures
							standing on a low rectangular base, arranged as if
							they are within an invisible cube. One figure, who
							seems to be the leader of the group, is placed
							almost in the middle of one of the long sides. 
							Otherwise, there is no obvious organization in their
							positions.  Furthermore, there is no point of view
							from which the six figures can be seen at once. For
							this reason the monument is visually interesting
							from all sides and, as the viewer walks it,
							additional details appear.
						</p>
						<p class="mod">
							Even though the burghers do not have much contact
							with each other, not even eye contact, they create a
							sense of a group by sharing many things.  They are
							about the same height (around 75”), wear similar
							long robes, and are barefoot. Although there are
							differences in the design of the clothes (some are
							sleeveless, some slit on the side), the deep folds
							of the simple robes create a strong vertical rhythm
							throughout the composition. Their disproportionately
							large hands and feet seem to weigh the men down. 
							Two of them carry large keys. There are pieces of
							ropes hanging or twisted on some of the figures.
						</p>
						<p class="mod">
							Looking at the work from the front (the longer side,
							with two figures facing towards us), the viewer
							first sees the man who seems to be the leader of the
							group, emphasized by an empty space in front of him.
							He is leaning forward with his shoulders hunched,
							his arms hanging by his sides, standing on a
							diagonal that runs from the front right corner
							towards the back left corner of the base. He is not
							facing us but turned about 30 degrees towards our
							left, with his head down. He has a beard, long hair,
							and he looks concerned.
						</p>
						<p class="mod">
							A second burgher is lined up on the same diagonal,
							with his large bare left foot placed almost on the
							right corner of the base.  Also turned toward the
							left, he looks straight forward with a grim
							expression.  He holds a giant key in front of his
							body. These two burghers are connected by their
							position within the sculpture and they seem older
							than the others. 
						</p>
						<p class="mod">
							On the left front corner of the base is a younger
							man who has turned his back to the group and seems
							to be walking away from the leader. While his body
							is facing the left side of the invisible cube of the
							composition, his head is turned towards the back and
							he is looking down. He holds his heavily muscled
							right arm in front of him at a 90 degree angle. His
							fingers are spread apart as if he is questioning the
							situation. If we move to the short side of the
							monument and face this figure, we see that he is
							leaning to his right side. His movement creates a
							curving line that defines that edge of the
							composition.
						</p>
						<p class="mod">
							From this point of view we can see the fourth
							burgher, who had been mostly hidden before.  He is
							positioned right next to the previously mentioned
							man. The fourth burgher is facing the center of the
							composition. He is in the midst of stepping forward,
							with his arms out and hands open.  His mouth is
							open, suggesting that he is asking something.  Seen
							from the short side of the sculpture, the two
							figures overlap, creating dynamic lines as they lean
							towards one another. These two burghers seem joined,
							not only because of their interlocking movements but
							because they are both young and seem to be
							questioning the situation.
						</p>
						<p class="mod">
							There are two more burghers in the composition, who
							cannot be paired with any of the others. Looking at
							the other long side of the monument, we have a side
							view of the fifth burgher.  He is an older bearded
							man who seems to be stepping from the right side
							towards the left.  His face looks blank as he stares
							straight forward.  He holds a large key with his
							left fingertips. His facial expression and posture
							seem to express resignation.  From this point of
							view we also see the back of the last burgher, who
							is placed in the corner to the left.  He is slightly
							leaning away from the group. Moving to the short
							side, we can see that this older burger has the most
							dramatic position.  He is bent over with his hands
							covering his lowered head, so that his face is
							hidden.  He seems to be in total despair.  From this
							point of view, we also discover that thick ropes
							hang around the neck of the second burgher.
						</p>
						<p class="mod">
							Although the size, the bronze material, and the
							seriousness of the expressions of the men make you
							realize that this is a monument, the composition
							makes you feel as if the figures are part of the
							world in which you are standing.  Walking around the
							work, you discover that the figures also are walking
							in something like a circle, except for the central
							man.  As might be true in real life, each step
							reveals new details and hides others.  A head or an
							arm of an invisible figure appears above the other
							men, or an elbow or hand blocks the view of
							something that normally would be more important. 
							For this reason, <em>Burghers of Calais </em>has a
							much more immediate emotional impact on the viewer
							than a formal grouping on a high base would have
							had.

						>:  The first test of any description is whether the
						reader can visualize the work of art.  Is this
						description clear?  Could you draw Rodin's sculpture? 
						Do you know what it contains?  Do you know all of the
						facts about it as a physical object - size, material,
						shape?  The next question is whether you are left
						feeling confused, or if there are things you still want
						to know.  Are there issues that are raised but not
						answered?  Look at a reproduction of it (unless you can
						see the real sculpture!).  Do you find aspects that seem
						essential but have been left out?  Are there things you
						would have emphasized that have been minimized?  Again,
						there is never only one way to write a description.
