					<h3>Iconographic Analysis</h3>
					<p class="mod">
						Considering a work of art in terms of the life of the
						person who made it creates one kind of historical
						context.  There are many other ways to relate a work to
						history, though, involving different elements of the
						period from which it came.  One of them is an
						iconographic analysis, which establishes the meaning a
						work of art had at the time it was made.  This may or
						may not include what the maker of the work intended or,
						usually a more important factor, what the person who
						paid for the work wanted. Any particular time or place
						provides different possible audiences, each of which
						will demand specific kinds of information and make
						certain assumptions.  The iconographic argument always
						depends upon assembling historical evidence to
						reconstruct these things.
					</p>
					<p>
						Like all types of art historical analysis, an
						iconographic analysis must begin with what can be seen
						in the object or objects being considered.  On the basis
						of these observations, the objects are related to other
						visual images and, probably, texts.  This process may
						involve considerable historical research in primary
						sources and many languages, or a single reference to an
						authoritative secondary source.  The result may be more
						than one interpretation.  If they are mutually
						exclusive, the historian and the reader must decide
						which one seems most convincing.  More often, though,
						different interpretations address different aspects of
						the work, so all of them can be historically accurate.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the easiest case, a work of art depicts a subject
						that can be identified by anyone who knows what to look
						for. A handful of scenes from the life of Jesus, for
						example, appear again and again in Christian art.  Just
						a few details are all it takes to turn a picture of a
						woman and an angel into an Annunciation, or a mother and
						a baby in a stable into a Nativity scene.  Images like
						these were meant to be understood by many people, and
						they use well-established traditions that lasted for
						centuries.  Research is needed to understand how a
						particular example differs from others and why that
						matters, or who created it and who paid for it, but the
						basic subject is clear.  Something for which there is no
						known context, on the other hand, or that describes
						private feelings of the artist or patron, may be very
						hard to interpret.
					</p>
					<p>
						Any iconographic analysis must explain as many visual
						elements in a work as possible.  This is not as easy as
						it sounds, because people tend to see what they “know”
						is there.  Leo Steinberg remarked about Michelangelo’s
						<em>Last Judgment</em> (Sistine Chapel, Vatican, Rome):
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>
							The fresco’s critical history is a classic instance
							of how an interpretative tradition feeds on itself,
							and how rarely the object interpreted is permitted
							to interfere.  Through four centuries of continuous
							exposure, the
							<em>Last Judgment</em> ranked with the world’s
							best-known monuments, incessantly reproduced and
							described, praised and denounced, scanned and
							scrutinized daily by thousands, with detail
							photographs available for the past hundred years. 
							Yet it was not until 1925 that the face in the
							flayed skin held by Saint Bartholomew (to the right
							below Christ) was identified as the artist’s
							self-portrait.  Why this delayed recognition?  What
							inhibited th[is] perception, which now seems so
							overwhelmingly obvious .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.?<a
								href="notes.html#n60"
								><sup>60</sup></a
							>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p class="mod">
						Sometimes, Steinberg observed, copies provide a new view
						of a familiar work:
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>
							Where a copy is manifestly at odds with its model,
							it not only leads me to see what the copyist missed
							but what I hadn’t noticed.  Ours is by nature a
							pejorative eye, better adapted to registering a
							mismatch than agreement.  The discrepancies that
							lead to the eye in comparing replicas with their
							ostensible models are jolts to one’s visual sloth.<a
								href="notes.html#n61"
								><sup>61</sup></a
							>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>
						The art historian most closely associated with
						iconographic analysis is Erwin Panofsky (1892-1968). 
						Panofsky brought his immense learning to the study of
						many subjects, but most of all to the study of
						Renaissance art.  In
						<em>Early Netherlandish Painting</em>, he argued for a
						very particular way of understanding pictures made in
						Northern Europe during the 15th century.  He suggested
						that many apparently ordinary objects actually symbolize
						religious ideas, with the result being a total
						“sanctification of the visible world.” The problem,
						however, is that if  “all forms meant to convey a
						symbolical idea could appear as ordinary plants,
						architectural details, implements, or pieces of
						furniture: how are we to decide where .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
						symbolism begins?”  Panofsky answered his own question:
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>
							We have to ask ourselves whether or not the
							symbolical significance of a given motif is a matter
							of established representational tradition
							.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.; whether or not a symbolical
							interpretation can be justified by definite texts or
							agrees with ideas demonstrably alive in the period
							[the work was made] and presumably familiar to its
							artists .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.; and to what extent such a
							symbolical interpretation is in keeping with the
							historical position and personal tendencies of the
							individual master.
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p class="mod">
						Beyond these tests of historical plausibility lies the
						ultimate test of what Panofsky called the restraint of
						“common sense.”<a href="notes.html#n62"
							><sup>62</sup></a
						>
					</p>
					<p>
						An early example of “disguised symbolism” discussed in
						Panofsky’s book is Robert Campin’s
						<em>Mérode Altarpiece</em> (Cloisters, Metropolitan
						Museum of Art, New York), which shows the Annunciation
						in the central panel and the couple who commissioned the
						painting and Joseph in the left and right wings
						respectively.  “The pot of lilies is perfectly at ease
						upon its table,” Panofsky wrote, “and if we did not know
						its symbolical implications from hundreds of other
						Annunciations we could not possibly infer from this one
						picture that it is more than a nice still-life
						feature.”  Because of the many other times lilies appear
						with Mary in the same scene, however, “we are safe in
						assuming that the pot of lilies has retained its
						significance as a symbol of chastity; but we have no way
						of knowing to what extent the other objects in the
						picture, also looking like nice still-life features, may
						be symbols as well.” He went on to suggest that several
						more were symbols, citing extensive visual and textual
						evidence as support:
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>
							The laver and basin .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [are] an indoors
							substitute for the ‘fountain of gardens’ and ‘well
							of living waters,’ one of the most frequent symbols
							of the Virgin’s purity.  The lions on the armrest of
							her bench bring to mind the Throne of Solomon
							.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [a] time-honored simile of the
							Madonna. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  And the candlestick,
							supporting the candle, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. was also a
							familiar symbol of Our Lady&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
							[although] the Marian symbolism of the candle itself
							seems to be superseded by the radiance of the Light
							Divine: the candle on the table has gone out,
							emitting a wisp of smoke, at the approach of the
							angel.<a href="notes.html#n63"><sup>63</sup></a>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>
						Panofsky’s understanding of Campin’s
						<em>Annunciation</em> transforms a detailed depiction of
						Mary and a splendidly winged angel Gabriel in a
						15th-century room into a description of the Virgin Mary
						in her many roles.  For the informed viewer, this
						includes not only a reminder of all the events that are
						to come, but also their ultimate significance.  These
						dimensions change the painting from one that tells a
						single story, a narrative painting, to one that alludes
						to the most profound truths of Christianity.  The
						kneeling donors shown in the left panel offer a model of
						response for the viewer, as reverent witnesses to the
						founding event of the religion.
					</p>
					<p>
						Panofsky used the same method to interpret Northern
						Renaissance paintings that did not have religious
						subjects.  His discussion of Jan van Eyck’s
						<em>Arnolfini Wedding</em> (National Gallery, London)
						begins with a full description of the “comfortably
						furnished interior, suffused with warm, dim light, [in
						which] Giovanni Arnolfini and his wife are represented
						in full length.”<a href="notes.html#n64"
							><sup>64</sup></a
						>
						Taking into account the positions of the two figures,
						their gestures, and their facial expressions, as well as
						the symmetry of the composition and the signature of the
						artist displayed so prominently on the back wall,
						Panofsky concluded that the picture shows a marriage
						ceremony.  If this is the meaning of the scene, then
						many individual details take on new meaning:
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>
							We begin to see that what looks like nothing but a
							well-appointed upper-middle-class interior is in
							reality a nuptial chamber, hallowed by sacramental
							associations and often sanctified  .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.. 
							It is not by chance that the scene takes place in a
							bedroom instead of a sitting room, for the
							matrimonial bed was so sacred that a married couple
							in bed could be shown and visited by the Trinity . .
							..  The crystal beads and the ‘spotless mirror’
							.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. are well-known symbols of Marian
							purity.  The fruit on the window sill recalls
							.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the state of innocence before the
							Fall of Man.  The little statue of St. Margaret,
							surmounting the back of the chair near the bed,
							invokes the patron saint of childbirth.  The dog, as
							seen on so many tombs of ladies, was an accepted
							emblem of marital faith.<a href="notes.html#n65"
								><sup>65</sup></a
							>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p class="mod">
						Although subsequent scholars have disagreed with many of
						the details of Panofsky’s account, many have accepted
						his interpretation of the scene as one related to the
						marriage of these two people.<a href="notes.html#n66"
							><sup>66</sup></a
						>
					</p>
					<p>
						Iconographic analysis must be used differently for those
						works of art that seem not to have a single meaning. 
						Sandro Botticelli’s
						<em>Primavera</em> (Uffizi, Florence), painted in Italy
						just a few decades after Van Eyck’s
						<em>Arnolfini Wedding</em>, has attracted the attention
						of many writers without one interpretation of it being
						accepted. “Are we dealing,” wrote Martin Kemp, “with a
						high-flown form of painted philosophy or a delightful
						piece of secular invention which works a playful theme
						on mythological characters, with a particular emphasis
						on scantily dressed women?” He concluded that there was
						no one key to meaning could be found in the historical
						evidence, especially when different points of view and
						points in time were considered: 
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>
							We may regard the immediate genesis of the picture
							as the devising of a delightful ensemble on the
							theme of the spring months over which Venus and
							Mercury preside.  We may even make the more specific
							proposal that the ensemble was devised as a gift to
							celebrate the politically motivated wedding in 1483
							of Lorenzo with Semiramide Appiani .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 
							We may imagine its assembly, much in the manner of a
							secular
							<em>Sacra conversazione</em>, with Venus [instead of
							Mary] and her [equivalent of Mary’s] attendant
							saints and angels, not as a narrative or mythology,
							but as an assemblage evoking the realm of the
							goddess – an orange grove in the Garden of the
							Hesperides – and symbolising the specific season
							which is uniquely conducive to the flowering of
							young love.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [Renaissance texts]
							can be regarded as providing a vital underlying
							sanction for the commissioning of this
							<em>type</em> of picture and give an insight into
							the set of knowledge and attitudes through which
							some privileged viewers may have been able to endow
							it with high significance .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<a
								href="notes.html#n67"
								><sup>67</sup></a
							>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p class="mod">
						In this analysis, multiple interpretations are not just
						possible, but they are historically defensible and exist
						simultaneously.  Even if the painting is, like Van
						Eyck’s <em>Arnolfini Wedding</em>, about a particular
						marriage, it does not represent the people involved or
						the ceremony.  Only “privileged viewers,” those who
						possessed special “knowledge and attitudes,” would be
						able to understand the subject.  In this reading of
						<em>Primavera</em>, allusiveness and indirect references
						to things the painting does not show are as much a part
						of the intended meaning as the elements that actually
						appear in the composition.
					</p>
					<p>
						Iconographic analysis also can be used to explain the
						meaning of a group of related works.  In
						<em
							>The Image on the Edge. The Margins of Medieval
							Art</em
						>, Michael Camille considered what seems to be a
						puzzling, even shocking, kind of image.  Around the most
						solemn prayers and sacred texts in many Gothic
						manuscripts, scribes introduced “lascivious apes,
						autophagic dragons, pot-bellied heads, harp-playing
						asses, arse-kissing priests and somersaulting
						jungleurs,” among many other things.<a
							href="notes.html#n68"
							><sup>68</sup></a
						>
						The problem for the art historian is to understand how a
						reader of the words &quot;Deus in audiutor&quot; (O Lord
						hear my prayer) at the beginning of a 14th-century
						<em>Book of Hours</em> (British Museum, London, and J.
						Pierpont Morgan Library, New York) could possibly
						maintain a mood of devotion and concentration when the
						page also shows:  “three monkeys [who] ape the gestures
						of the wise men seen above,” “a spiky-winged ape-angel
						[who] grasps the tail of the ‘D’ [of ‘Deus’], as if he
						is about to pull the string that will unravel it all,”
						“a marvellous monster, known as a sciapod because of his
						one enormous foot, who proffers a golden crown,”“a
						glaring gryllus,” and more.<a href="notes.html#n69"
							><sup>69</sup></a
						>
						These images, equivalents of which exist in Gothic
						sculpture, seem inconceivable in a sacred context to a
						modern viewer.  Thus an analysis of them has to consider
						not only what they meant, but how they could exist at
						all.
					</p>
					<p>
						Camille tried to find evidence of a way of thinking as a
						context in which these images would have made sense to
						their medieval viewers.  Like Kemp, he looked for a “set
						of knowledge and attitudes” they might reflect.  First
						he considered how 19th- and 20th-century writers had
						described them, but dismissed their concepts as
						inappropriate:
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>
							The butterfly juxtaposed with a cooking-pot in the
							right margin of the opposite page [of the
							<em>Book of Hours</em>] might remind modern
							observers of the Surrealists’ pleasure in the
							‘fortuitous meeting of a sewing machine and an
							umbrella on an operating table’.  But . . . the
							exquisite incongruity of medieval marginal art
							refuses us the illusion of a
							dream.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  Other words that, like
							‘surreal’, are inappropriate for describing these
							creatures include the Romantic term ‘fantastic’
							.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and, most important of all, the
							negatively loaded term ‘grotesque’.
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p class="mod">
						Then Camille looked at words used by medieval writers,
						hoping to find a category to which the images might
						belong.  Among the terms that seemed useful were the
						Latin &quot;fibula&quot; or &quot;curiositates&quot; (a
						fable; an elaboration, an extravagance) or a variant of
						&quot;babuini&quot; (monkey-business), or
						&quot;fatrasies&quot; from &quot;fatras&quot; (trash or
						rubbish), a genre of humorous poetry found in the
						Franco-Flemish region from which the
						<em>Book of Hours</em> came.  The only problem with
						likening these types of writing to the Gothic works he
						was analyzing is that they did not exist in sacred
						contexts.  A crucial aspect of the visual imagery is
						that the “systematic incoherence of marginal art is
						placed within, perhaps even against, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the
						Word of God.”<a href="notes.html#n70"><sup>70</sup></a>
					</p>
					<p>
						Camille concluded two things.  One is that the modern
						sense of an absolute separation between the sacred and
						the secular does not correspond to medieval attitudes. 
						All kinds of manuscripts, lives of saints as well as
						bawdy tales, could be bound together in a single
						volume.  This mixing of very different things seems
						typical of the period:
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>
							The concoction of hybrids, mingling different
							registers and genres, seems to have been both a
							verbal and a visual fashion for elite
							audiences.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  But this still does
							not answer the question of what it was that such
							elevated patrons wanted in this garbage-world, this
							apish, reeling and drunken discourse that filled the
							margins of their otherwise scrupulously organized
							lives.<a href="notes.html#n71"><sup>71</sup></a>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p class="mod">
						To answer the question of what might be meant by such
						mixing, Camille looked again at the
						<em>Book of Hours</em> with which he had begun his
						inquiry.
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>
							Every element springs into disordered life:
							line-endings lurch, rabbits run out from behind pen
							squiggles, hands emerge from holes in the vellum to
							play catch across the page.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 
							Cooking-pots boil and pour water of their own
							accord, while other household objects dance . . .. 
							Alongside the solemn text of the Office of the Dead,
							skeletons grin and cavort in playful
							putrefaction.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
						</p>
						<p class="mod">
							These images would not have shocked the
							Franco-Flemish lady who used this book, precisely
							because they articulated her
							world.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  The people of the
							Middle Ages saw themselves at the edge, the last
							ageing dregs of a falling-off of humanity, the
							dissipated end of a Golden Age eagerly awaiting the
							Last Judgement.<a href="notes.html#n72"
								><sup>72</sup></a
							>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p class="mod">
						In other words, the prayer book comes from a world that
						viewed itself as near its end.  This idea informed every
						aspect of life and, in Camille's view, provides the
						context needed to understand the images.
					</p>
					<p>
						Historians of 19th- and 20th-century art often face
						another kind of problem.  The subject of a work seems so
						immediate as to need no interpretation at all.  Many
						Impressionist paintings create a sense of just this ease
						of access.  In fact, it forms an important part of their
						appeal. John House discussed this question at the
						beginning of his book about Pierre-Auguste Renoir’s
						<em>La Promenade</em> (J. Paul Getty Museum, Los
						Angeles):
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>
							At first sight, <em>La Promenade </em>is one of the
							most engaging and approachable of all Impressionist
							paintings.  Dappled sunlight plays across a woodland
							glade; a young man pulls the foliage aside from a
							narrow path to allow his female companion to pass;
							she turns her head aside, perhaps momentarily
							hesitant to go farther into the woods.  The
							[painting] technique – ebullient, variegated,
							informal – complements this scene of relaxed
							companionship and courtship.  To
							late-twentieth-century eyes the work raises few
							questions and poses few problems .&nbsp;.&nbsp;..
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p class="mod">
						After assessing the usefulness of a variety of
						historical sources of information about the painting,
						House stated the goal of his analysis:  “How did
						Renoir’s choice of this theme and the ways in which he
						treated it relate to the art of his contemporaries and
						to contemporary debates about the purpose of fine art
						and its role in society?”<a href="notes.html#n73"
							><sup>73</sup></a
						>
						In other words, what was the world like in which
						<em>La Promenade</em> was made, and how does that
						knowledge contribute to our understanding of this
						particular picture.
					</p>
					<p>
						The analytical methods used by House are the same as
						those used by Panofsky, Kemp, and Camille.  Despite the
						fact that
						<em>La Promenade</em> has no hidden symbolism or
						reference to mythology or religion, it too was created
						in a visual context that can be reconstructed by looking
						at similar pictures from the same period and texts
						written about similar subjects.  The most important
						difference is that what the artist said about the work
						might survive, along with responses from
						contemporaries.  So the first question the historian
						must consider is what importance should be given to
						which sources and, second, whether the artist has a
						privileged place in determining the meaning of a work. 
						What if the artist’s stated intention makes no sense of
						what viewers see?  What if, instead of seeming like
						different aspects of the same meaning, the two seem
						incompatible? Who matters more, the artist or the
						viewer?
					</p>
					<p>
						House decided that evidence from the 1860s and 1870s,
						the time when Renoir painted <em>La Promenade</em>, was
						more revealing than statements the artist made late in
						his life.  “Many of the stories about Renoir and most of
						the accounts about his views come from his old
						age.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  His accounts of his early
						career were viewed through the filter of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
						later concerns.”<a href="notes.html#n74"
							><sup>74</sup></a
						>
						By contrast, the
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>
							figures and setting [in <em>La Promenade</em>]
							linked it closely to contemporary social and moral
							debates, and the action itself is not seamless: the
							viewer is invited to interpret the play of gestures,
							although no clear outcome to the action is
							indicated.  On the borderline between popular
							illustration and fine art painting, its imagery
							would have resonated with familiar narratives of
							courtship and seduction, while its status as a fine
							art painting and its “artistic” technique would have
							marked it as an object of high culture, appealing to
							an enlightened elite.<a href="notes.html#n75"
								><sup>75</sup></a
							>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p class="mod">
						In other words, <em>La Promenade</em> represents not
						only a story suggested by the two figures, but also a
						very curious picture in 19th-century terms.  The subject
						and the method of painting seemed to be at odds.  The
						first was compatible with images that were popular at
						exhibitions and appeared by the thousands in
						contemporary publications.  The second was new and
						distinctively modern, thus identifying the work as one
						of great artistic ambition. 
					</p>
					<p>
						This sense of contradiction between subject and
						technique, and recognition of deliberate choices
						dictated by an artistic purpose, are dimensions of
						<em>La Promenade</em> that modern viewers do not see. 
						Separating the subject from the way it was painted
						creates a new way of looking at the picture, and
						suggests a method that can be applied to other works. 
						House concluded: “In a sense this paradoxical
						combination sums up the early history of Impressionism –
						an utter rejection of the idealist world of academic
						art, coupled with an appeal to a new elite that placed
						the highest value on the virtuoso transformation of the
						individual’s <em>sensations</em> into fine art.”<a
