		<h3>Historical Analysis</h3>
		<p class="mod">Iconographic  analysis is used to establish the meaning of a particular work at a particular  time.  To identify the subject of an  altarpiece as a Madonna and Child, however, explains nothing about the use of  the altarpiece, how it fit into the surrounding culture, its economic import,  or what it may reveal about social and political issues of the period. These  questions apply most naturally to the study of objects from the past, but the  same methods can be applied to contemporary art.  What matters is the way the context is  described and what kinds of relationships are established between it and the  work or works being studied.  This type  of analysis is richest when it creates a web of very specific connections. To  juxtapose a few generalizations about a historical context with a work from the  period without suggesting any particular relationships between the two does not  reveal very much.</p>
		<p> Like so many kinds of writing about  art, historical analysis became the subject of sustained investigation during  the 19th century by scholars writing in German.   Jacob Burckhardt (1818-1897) wrote the first major studies of art as an  aspect of culture in his books about the Italian Renaissance, published during  the 1860s.  The idea that art should be  considered primarily in terms of the economic structure that produced it rather  than aesthetics was explored by Karl Marx (1818-1883).  The influence on art of culture in its  broadest definition, including politics, religion, and social conventions, as  well as popular imagery and magical or irrational beliefs, became the subject  of systematic study by Aby Warburg (1866-1929) in the late 19th and early 20th  centuries.  Different sorts of questions  have been asked in the past few decades, as art historians have considered  feminism, gender studies, and the impact of colonialism.<a href="notes.html#n77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
		<p> In practice, art historians usually  mix the types of analysis they use.  The  topic being studied may suggest certain questions and preclude others, or the  writer may have very specific interests.  One person might consider only those issues that are directly relevant  to works of art.  Another might use art  as one type of evidence among many to investigate larger historical questions.  The point of view chosen determines the shape of the analysis.  For this reason, it is very important for the  writer to be clear about his or her objective and then consider the best ways  to achieve it.  Not all questions and not  all sources will be equally useful.</p>
		<p> Sometimes contemporary events  overwhelm a society, affecting every aspect of life. In <em>Painting in Florence  and Siena after the Black Death. The Arts, Religion, and Society in the Mid-Fourteenth Century</em>, Millard Meiss (1904-1975) argued that this  happened at a moment central to the history of Italian Renaissance art.  The book begins with a statement of his  purpose:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p> The  present book deals with Florentine and Sienese painting from around 1350 to  1375.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [T]hose aspects of reality and those problems of form that had occupied the  leading masters of the first half of the century, and that were soon again to  occupy the artists of the early Renaissance, were suddenly opposed by other  values.  The painters became engrossed  with qualities which do not easily find a place in the evolution leading from  Giotto to Masaccio, or from Simone [Martini] and the Lorenzetti [brothers] to  Sassetta.  The first part of the book  endeavors to show that these qualities, however foreign to this evolution and  to classical taste, are coherent and purposeful, and that the more important  paintings of the time present a unique range of meaning and form.  The subsequent chapters confront the problem  of the emergence of this art, and they attempt to interpret it in the light of  contemporary religious sentiment, contemporary literary thought, and a state of  mind that was affected by a series of unusual events.<a href="notes.html#n78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="mod">After  a number of political and economic disruptions, “unimaginable catastrophe  struck both towns.  Suddenly during the  summer months of 1348 more than half of the inhabitants of Florence and Siena  died of the bubonic plague.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  Those  fortunate few who were able to escape those horrible scenes of [death and  dying] were .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. overwhelmed by the loss of family and friends.”<a href="notes.html#n79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>
		<p> Life for survivors of the plague was  changed in every respect.  Economic  disruption had brought great prosperity and political power to some.  These new patrons of the arts, Meiss argued,  “adhered to more traditional patterns of thought and feeling” which were better  expressed by religious art of the late 13th century than by the new  styles of the first half of the 14th century.<a href="notes.html#n80"><sup>80</sup></a> Religious piety became particularly intense, and new subjects entered art while  old ones were represented in new ways. “The writing of the period, like the  painting, was pervaded by a profound pessimism and sometimes a renunciation of  life.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [T]he brevity of life and the certainty of death .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. was preached  from the pulpits .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and set forth in paintings, both altarpieces and  murals.”<a href="notes.html#n81"><sup>81</sup></a> Finally, religious institutions were flooded with donations from people who  were dying or who expected to die.  These  resources permitted the beginning of ambitious projects of building and  decoration.<a href="notes.html#n82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>
		<p>  <em>Painting and  Experience in Fifteenth-Century Italy</em> by Michael Baxandall (1933-2008), about art made just half a century  later than that discussed by Meiss, is not about the extraordinary but about  the ordinary.  He too studied the  “institutions and conventions – commercial, religious, perceptual, in the  widest sense social – that were different from ours and influenced the forms of  what they together made.”<a href="notes.html#n83"><sup>83</sup></a> Baxandall tried to recover the assumptions of painters and viewers, the things  they would have thought important and the things they would have taken for  granted.  He considered all sorts of  historical information to construct an image of a “Quattrocento cognitive style  as it relates to Quattrocento pictorial style.”<a href="notes.html#n84"><sup>84</sup></a> Religious texts and the nature of the commission determined important aspects  of the way religious pictures looked.<a href="notes.html#n85"><sup>85</sup></a> All images, religious and secular, used conventional ways to represent the  human figure, especially in its movements.   In Botticelli’s <em>Primavera</em>, “the central figure of Venus is not  beating time to the dance of the Graces but inviting us with hand and glance  into her kingdom.  We miss the point of  the picture if we mistake the gesture.”<a href="notes.html#n86"><sup>86</sup></a> Baxandall also identified ways of describing the world visually that were found  in business as well as specialized professions such as medicine, preaching, and  dance.<a href="notes.html#n87"><sup>87</sup></a> Finally, he analyzed the words in a Florentine text about art to establish the  vocabulary used by 15th-century viewers of the pictures.<a href="notes.html#n88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>
		<p>			The historical context Baxandall  constructed depends upon extensive and inventive archival research, beyond the  reach of all but a few scholars.  The  method he used, however, can be taken as a model:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p> A  society develops its distinctive skills and habits, which have a visual aspect,  since the visual sense is the main organ of experience, and these visual skills  and habits become part of the medium of the painter: correspondingly, a  pictorial style gives access to the visual skills and habits and, through  these, to the distinctive social experience.   An old picture is a record of a visual activity.  One has to learn to read it, just as one has  to learn to read a text from a different culture, even when one knows, in a  limited sense, the language: both language and pictorial representation are  conventional activities.<a href="notes.html#n89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="mod">Thinking  of a work of art as the product of a conventional activity is useful for any  writer.</p>
		<p> John Barrell analyzed a different  kind of image and a different world in <em>The Dark Side of the Landscape. The  Rural Poor in English Painting, 1730-1840</em>.   He argued that the vision of rural life described by Thomas Gainsborough  and John Constable, among others, “can be understood only by understanding the  constraints .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that determined how the poor could, or rather how they could <em>not</em> be represented.”<a href="notes.html#n90"><sup>90</sup></a> These pictures of rural life offer “the image of a stable, unified, almost  egalitarian society.”  Only by  considering this “mythical unity” in terms of what is shown, how it is organized  within the composition, and how this relates to the social realities of the  time can the way in which the painters constructed this “artifice” be  understood.  Furthermore, Barrell  suggested, these “constraints still operate in subtle ways today.”  “We should ask ourselves whether we do not  still, in the ways we admire Gainsborough, Stubbs, and Constable, identify with  the interests of their customers [who purchased these pictures] and against the  poor they portray.”<a href="notes.html#n91"><sup>91</sup></a> In other words, Barrell’s analysis also may explain ways in which  modern viewers respond to these pictures. </p>
		<p> Even a single work can reveal a  great deal about the society that produced it. Simon Schama and Svetlana Alpers  both wrote about Jan Vermeer’s <em>Allegory of Painting</em> (Kunsthistorisches  Museum, Vienna). A major work by Vermeer, it is of great interest for what it  suggests, or might suggest, about the artist’s conception of painting.</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p> [Vermeer]  portrayed [the artist] from behind, dressed in a fanciful costume from a past  era.  The importance of the artist’s work  is evident in the elegant room in which he paints, with its chandelier, lush  curtain, and chairs.  Most significantly,  the artist is portraying an allegorical figure, Clio, the muse of History.</p>
		<p class="mod"> Clio is posed as described by Cesare  Ripa [in his book of symbols], as a girl with a crown of laurel, symbolizing  Fame, and holding a trumpet and a volume of Thucydides, symbolizing History.<a href="notes.html#n92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="mod">Schama  and Alpers, however, were not interested in any of those aspects of the painting  so much as in the large map that hangs behind the figures on the wall of the  studio.  For both historians, that one  detail offers important information about contemporary attitudes.</p>
		<p> For Schama, the map in Vermeer’s <em>Allegory  of Painting</em> reveals the complexity of the Dutch sense of identity at the  time:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p> It  had taken almost a century .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. before “the Fatherland” became exclusively  associated in Dutch minds with the seven provinces and their directly governed  territories in Flanders, Brabant, and Limburg.   Even then, there remained some groups in the population, by no means all  Calvinist, who yearned for a “reunion” across the river barriers.  Dutch Catholics, who constituted over a third  of the population, stood to gain the most .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.   It may be that Vermeer .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. expressed such a nostalgic view of the old  Netherlands and its art in his <em>Allegory of Painting</em> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  In the map that appears so prominently above  the figure of the painter (once thought to be a self-portrait) the Fatherland  is represented, not in its new guise, as the seven provinces of the Republic,  but the seventeen of the humanist Renaissance.<a href="notes.html#n93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="mod">In  this way, Vermeer’s picture both illustrates and seems to prove  Schama’s  thesis about the development of a national identity.  Furthermore, it combines two crucial factors  – the physical definition of the country and the role religion played in how  people felt. Although Schama’s purpose was not a general discussion of Vermeer,  in fact his analysis gives the artist a place and a context that is very  relevant to an art historical understanding of the painting and its maker.   </p>
		<p> Svetlana Alpers wrote about the  culture of the period.  In <em>The Art of  Describing. Dutch Art in the Seventeenth Century</em>, she argued for a new way  of understanding the art by placing it within contemporary “visual culture” (a  term she credited to Baxandall).<a href="notes.html#n94"><sup>94</sup></a> One characteristic of this culture and of its art, she suggested, is “the  mapping impulse,” which she defined with a lengthy analysis of Vermeer’s <em>Allegory  of Painting</em>.  Like Schama, she found  the map hanging on the wall to be filled with meaning.  Unlike him, Alpers built her interpretation  on the visual role the map plays in the picture.  First, it is a “powerful pictorial presence”  which catches the viewer’s attention in many ways.  The details are so specific that the  particular map can be identified.  It is  large, with many visual components, including lettering, pictures, and the  lines of the map itself.  Finally,  Vermeer placed his signature on it.  In  all these ways, Vermeer likened the painting to the map and, by extension, the  act of painting to the act of map-making.   For Alpers, this similarity reveals something essential about the Dutch  idea of painting:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p> The  aim of Dutch painters was to capture on a surface a great range of knowledge  and information about the world.  They  too employed words with their images.   Like the mappers, they made additive works that could not be taken in  from a single viewing point.  Theirs was  not a window on the Italian model of art but rather, like a map, a surface on  which is laid out an assemblage of the world.<a href="notes.html#n95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Both authors drew upon tremendous  knowledge of the period in their analyses of Vermeer’s painting.  Both also used the painting as evidence of  larger attitudes.  Schama’s book is about  the historical period though, and the visual character of this particular  picture is not relevant.  The things at  the core of Alpers’s discussion &ndash; especially the importance of the map in the  composition and the extraordinary amount of detail that can be seen in it &ndash; illustrate an idea that is not directly related to the meaning of the  painting.  For Alpers though, the  painting is of interest in all its aspects.   The things shown in it as well as their arrangement identify fundamental  qualities in Dutch art of the period. </p>
		<p> In many ways, the argument made by  Alpers about Vermeer’s painting is closer to a stylistic analysis than to  Schama’s historical analysis. Although the likeness is real, the differences  are important.  Like Wölfflin, Alpers identified  characteristics in many particular works and used them to form a notion of a  period style.  The characteristics belong  to the culture of the period, however, defined by activities such as map-making  and optics, not the appearance of the art. Presenting a particular work as part  of the surrounding culture makes a conceptual likeness to maps more revealing  and more useful than a visual likeness to other pictures by Vermeer or his  contemporaries.  Like Baxandall, she  looked at other visual activities of the time to help understand the pictures  in their original context.  </p>
		<p> A more complicated problem of  cultural analysis arises when the same work of art plays an important role in  very different societies.  Sub-Saharan  African sculpture, for example, profoundly influenced modern Western  artists.  Yet, as Frank Willett  explained, people from each society would see the works very differently: “A  great deal of satisfaction can indeed be found in looking at African sculpture  without background information, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but one is not necessarily sharing in the  sculptor’s experience or enjoying the sensation he intended to convey.”<a href="notes.html#n96"><sup>96</sup></a> Not only is the original meaning lost, but mood and expression, qualities that  deeply interested modern artists, are very likely to be misread. Furthermore,  the constraints of the original context are completely unknown to the modern  viewer.  In fact, “there were two forces  at work in the creation of traditional African sculpture: the established artistic  style appropriate to the type of the object being made, and the individual  vision of the carver himself.”<a href="notes.html#n97"><sup>97</sup></a> These are not things that can be understood by looking at a single work, or  generalizing from one work to others. </p>
		<p> To understand how tribal objects  appeared and functioned in the time and place of their making requires an  imaginative recreation of an entire world.   This involves more than an anthropological study of the society. It also  concerns the words and concepts used to describe visual things.  Robert Thompson put together a list of  nineteen visual criteria Yoruba people mentioned repeatedly when talking about  their sculpture.  The qualities include:  “jijora, or the moderate resemblance to the subject,” “ifarahon, visibility,”  or clarity in the massing of the forms, “didon, luminosity, or shining  smoothness of surface,” and “gigun, a straight upright posture and symmetrical  arrangement of the parts of the sculpture.”<a href="notes.html#n98"><sup>98</sup></a> With this list, Thompson created something like Baxandall’s definition of the  15th-century Italian Renaissance “period eye.”</p>
		<p> Roger Fry wrote about and collected  African art, one of many modern critics and artists to do so.  In his last lectures, given at the Slade  School in London during the mid-1930s, Fry argued that modern art owed more to  African art than to any other tradition.<a href="notes.html#n99"><sup>99</sup></a> Using the vivid and eloquent language for which he had become famous, Fry  described a number of works to indicate the great range of form and style that  could be found in African sculpted heads:</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p> [In  one head, t]he artist has seized on the dome-like dominance of the forehead,  and he has found how to support it by increasing immensely the bulging salience  of the eyes and, with slight variations, the prominence of the nose; and  against these he has played the straight line of the base of the nose and the  terrible horizontal prominence of mouth and teeth.  But, as often as not, an African sculptor  will suppress the mouth altogether, or reduce it to a slit, and build on the  hollow of the eye-orbit, in exact contradiction to the treatment of this head,  which eliminates the orbit almost entirely.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. </p>
		<p class="mod"> [Another work shows] an utterly  different choice .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The mouth is almost suppressed, and the ridge of the  nose becomes a support to the almost plant-like exfoliation of the eyes.  These are deeply undercut beneath the  eyelids, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [creating] deep shadows beneath the weight of the prominent lids  .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The hair treated with extraordinary delicacy and precision picks up again  the almost vegetable regularity of the features.  This chevelure folds like a calyx round the  forehead.  And here again, what delicate  sensibility the curvature of the brow shows; how right, we feel, the bold  flattening of the cheeks and what a rare discovery is the sharp but delicate  salience of the chin, which seems to close and hold this strangely beautiful  plastic sequence.<a href="notes.html#n100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>In an article about abstract art published  just a few years later, in 1937, Meyer Schapiro (1904-1996) suggested how  complicated the relationship was between Western artists and “primitive” art.</p>
<blockquote>		<p> A  whole complex of longings, moral values and broad conceptions of life were  fulfilled in [this new responsiveness to primitive art].  If colonial imperialism made these primitive  objects physically accessible, they could have little aesthetic interest until  the new formal conceptions arose.  But  these formal conceptions could be relevant to primitive art only when charged  with the new valuations of the instinctive, the natural, the mythical as the  essentially human .&nbsp;.&nbsp;..  Time ceased to  be an historical dimension; it became an internal psychological moment, and the  whole mess of material ties, the nightmare of a determining world, the  disquieting sense of the present as a dense historical point to which the  individual was fatefully bound – these were automatically transcended in thought  by the conception of an instinctive, elemental art above time. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  The colonies became places to flee to as well  as to exploit.<a href="notes.html#n101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>		
<p class="mod">Schapiro’s  interpretation gives a different sense to Fry’s words. It makes clear the  degree to which they are part of Western artistic traditions and Western ways  of describing.  It also gives them an  emotional edge, a sense of discovery that is bound to larger concerns.  As Willett suggested, the sculptures Fry saw  were not the ones that had been made by particular people in sub-Saharan  Africa.  Although physically the same  objects, they had been transformed in appearance and meaning by historical  context.</p>
		<p> Gender &ndash; of artists, patrons, and  viewers, as well as artistic subjects – has become a major area of study in the  past few decades.  Botticelli’s <em>Primavera</em> is one painting that looks very different in light of feminist and gender  studies. An important older art historical study of the nude is by  Kenneth Clark (1903-1983), who created a distinction still used today:</p>
		<blockquote>		<p> The  English language, with its elaborate generosity, distinguishes between the  naked and the nude.  To be naked is to be  deprived of our clothes, and the word implies some of the embarrassment most of  us feel in that condition.  The word  “nude,” on the other hand, carries .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. no uncomfortable overtones.  The vague image it projects into the mind is  not of a huddled and defenseless body, but of a balanced, prosperous, and  confident body: the body re-formed.  In  fact, the word was forced into our vocabulary by critics of the early  eighteenth century to persuade the artless islanders [of Britain] that, in  countries where painting and sculpture were practiced and valued as they should  be, the naked human body was the central subject of art.<a href="notes.html#n102"><sup>102</sup></a></p>
		</blockquote>		
<p class="mod">Botticelli’s <em>Primavera</em> is one of the many images discussed by Clark.  With the figures of the three Graces, Clark  wrote, Botticelli “achieved an extraordinary affinity with Greek figures that  he cannot possibly have seen.”  By  presenting them as dancers, he showed their bodies in movement, covered with  the flowing lines of near-transparent garments.   “So naked beauty reappeared in the Renaissance as it first emerged in  Greece, protected and enhanced by <em>draperie  mouillée”</em> (or “wet drapery”).<a href="notes.html#n103"><sup>103</sup></a> The central figure was an ideal “gentle priestess.”<a href="notes.html#n104"><sup>104</sup></a></p>
		<p>			Considering <em>Primavera</em> in  terms of its historical and cultural context as well as gender studies, rather  than the artistic tradition of the representation of the human nude, produces a  radically different understanding.   Lilian Zirpolo argued that one way the painting should be seen is “as a  model of behavior for the bride,” in whose honor the picture had been  commissioned:</p>
		<blockquote>		<p> Botticelli’s  Graces .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. represent not only purity and chastity but also the demeanor that  befitted the virtuous Renaissance woman.   Their measured and elegant gestures and their unemotional facades evoke  not only .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [the] concept of the commendable maiden but also .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the ideal  wife.  In the <em>Primavera</em>, the Three Graces perform a dance with movements that are  as calculated and restrained as the movements .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. recommended for a virtuous  wife.<a href="notes.html#n105"><sup>105</sup></a></p>
		</blockquote>		<p class="mod">This  is close to Baxandall’s analysis of the figures in terms of gesture and  dance.  Zirpolo then turned to the nature  of noble marriages in the Renaissance, a subject that adds another aspect to  her study.  Since such marriages were  arranged for political, economic, and dynastic advantage, it was essential that  the bride submit to the will of her husband.   This is also represented in Botticelli’s painting, Zirpolo wrote:</p>
<blockquote>		<p> This  vision of marriage for the sake of the families and the emphasis on the bride’s  submission are expressed by the depicted rape scene showing Chloris pursued by  Zephyrus, the West Wind, whose intention is to ravish her.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  To compensate Chloris for his actions,  Zephryus married her and gave her the domain of flowers, changing her name to  Flora. </p>
		<p class="mod"> Within the festive atmosphere that  permeates the <em>Primavera</em>, the  brutality of the rape scene can hardly be discerned.  Yet, upon close scrutiny it becomes evident  that, in contrast to the other female figures in the painting, who are tall,  slender, and graceful, Chloris has a beastlike appearance.  Her stance resembles that of a frightened and  animal defenseless animal, a panic-stricken creature who tries in vain to flee  as she is about to fall prey to her hunter.</p></blockquote>
		<p class="mod">Zirpolo  supported her visual observations by citing several contemporary traditions  about marriage that might justify associating it with rape.<a href="notes.html#n106"><sup>106</sup></a></p>
		<p>Roger Fry also discussed Botticelli’s  paintings: </p>
		<blockquote>		<p> How  all these images are charged with emotive power!  To begin with, the nude figure, however  idealized and etherealized it may be, as it is here, must carry some vague  overtones of sexual feeling.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [The subject] carries with it a whole mass  of suggestions which will vary with the degree of the spectator’s knowledge of  Classical poetry.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  But when we pass  from the imagery to the mode in which it is presented, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we are getting  into closer contact with Botticelli’s spirit.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And at this point we begin  to yield ourselves to the rhythmical movements of Botticelli’s linear design,  to its mazy interweft of curves leading us on with a charmed motion from one to  another with echoes arising from all different parts of the design.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  But my main purpose has been to make clear to  you how complicated a matter a work of art may be and to indicate at how many  points two spectators may diverge in their reactions, each starting off, it may  be, upon some side track down which their personal make-up or their past  experiences may tempt them.<a href="notes.html#n107"><sup>107</sup></a></p>
		</blockquote>		<p class="mod">In beautiful and evocative language, Fry  suggested the potential richness of any work of art.  He did not dictate the response of the  spectator or the direction of possible research.  He only insisted that investigations be based  on very careful looking, and that the conclusions be written as clearly as  possible.</p>		<!-- InstanceEndEditable -->		</div>
