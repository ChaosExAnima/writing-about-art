					<h3>Visual Description</h3>
					<p class="mod">
						The simplest visual description uses ordinary words to
						convey what the writer sees.  First he or she must look
						at the subject &ndash; slowly, carefully, and
						repeatedly, if possible &ndash; to identify the parts
						that make the whole. These parts must be sorted into the
						more and the less important, since no description can
						include everything, and assumptions must be separated
						from actual observations. It is easy to confuse what we
						see with what we think we see, or what we know is
						there.  Then comes the difficult job of finding
						appropriate words. In effect, writing a visual
						description consists of two separate acts of
						translation.  The first transforms a visual experience
						into a verbal one and the second turns a private
						experience into one that can be communicated to someone
						else.
					</p>
					<p>
						Any writer takes some things for granted. It is crucial
						to understand what these things are and then consider
						them in terms of both the purpose of the description and
						the interests of the reader.  For example, to describe
						the sky in a particular 17th-century Dutch landscape
						painting as cloudy indicates one aspect of the picture
						in a general way.  It leaves entirely unexplained the
						specific elements that create the visual effect – like
						the shapes and colors of the clouds, the way they have
						been arranged, or how they suggest space.  These
						qualities cannot be imagined by a reader who has not
						been given explicit details.  In the same way,
						identifying something by artist, title, and date might
						be all a specialist needs to visualize the work.  Anyone
						else, however, will need to be told much more.
					</p>
					<p>
						Generally speaking, the best place to begin a visual
						description is with an explanation of the subject and
						the materials of the work.  Together they provide enough
						information to orient any reader.  In most cases,
						though, neither will be enough by itself.  To say that a
						work of art shows a woman and a child, but not whether
						the representation is in two or three dimensions, makes
						it hard to form even the roughest mental image.  If,
						however, the writer says that the work is a life-size
						sculpture of a woman and child, the reader can begin to
						imagine what it might look like.  He or she also will
						know enough to have questions.  A good written
						description will anticipate these questions and provide
						information in an order that answers them.
					</p>
					<p>
						Additional observations can make the first sentence even
						more useful.  Perhaps the artist is famous, and “a
						life-size sculpture of a woman and child by Henry Moore”
						would convey a great deal to the reader.  Perhaps the
						subject is the Virgin Mary and Jesus, an identification
						filled with meaning for someone who is knowledgeable
						about Christianity.  Maybe the sculptor is not known and
						the subject has not been identified.  Then describing
						the relationship between the figures might be helpful. 
						To say that the work is a life-size sculpture of a
						seated woman holding a small child on her lap gives the
						reader a beginning.  Of course the introductory sentence
						cannot hold too much information.  It must strike a
						balance between giving the reader a few vague
						generalities and trying to convey everything at once.
					</p>
					<p>
						A traditional work of art is, first of all, a physical
						object.  The material or materials used may not be
						possible to identify by just looking.  Perhaps they look
						like something they are not, or the surface and texture
						have been obscured by layers of paint.  In cases like
						these, the correct identification can be brought to the
						attention of the reader, but not as part of what anyone
						can see.  This is an instance of knowing being different
						from seeing.  If information is based on an external
						source, even a museum label, the source must be cited
						after it has been verified.  Many mistakes get repeated
						as facts by people who did not bother to check them.
					</p>
					<p>
						The size of a work is always crucial. The effect made on
						a viewer by an object that can be held in the hand,
						compared to a billboard that covers the side of a
						building, is so different as to make any similarities
						seem almost inconsequential.  The first demands a very
						intimate relationship, with careful and close looking to
						see what is there.  The other must be seen from a
						distance and may contain details that are too small to
						be comprehensible.  Scale also influences the design of
						a work, since the same composition, colors, and methods
						of making rarely transfer effectively from a small
						format to a very large one, or vice versa.  This is
						another reason why size must be considered in a visual
						description.
					</p>
					<p>
						Color matters.  Even if it is not part of the subject,
						it influences the way we look at a work.  Bright colors
						catch our eye before dark ones do, and even subtle
						changes may matter a great deal.  The sense of space
						created within an abstract painting by Wassily Kandinsky
						comes from the colors he chose as much as the shapes. 
						Often the color of a work has changed over time. Some
						Greek sculptures, which we are accustomed to see as
						white marble, were painted with lifelike colors. Our
						expectations make reconstructions look startlingly
						incorrect.<a href="notes.html#n5"><sup>5</sup></a> The
						controversy that surrounded the cleaning of
						Michelangelo’s paintings in the Sistine Chapel at the
						Vatican was partly about technical matters, but also
						about the tremendous change it made to the colors. 
						Those who accepted the results of the cleaning as
						historically correct had to revise their ideas about
						Michelangelo as an artist as well as about the history
						of 16th-century Italian art.<a href="notes.html#n6"
							><sup>6</sup></a
						>
					</p>
					<p>
						The qualities listed above explain why a reproduction
						can never substitute for an original.  A good copy will
						convey certain elements of the work, but it cannot
						convey them all. Even an excellent color photograph of
						an oil painting, a two-dimensional picture of a
						two-dimensional picture, will leave out more information
						than it gives. The same is even more true with
						reproductions of three-dimensional objects.  A single
						image communicates only one point of view, and it cannot
						indicate size, shape, surface, or volume.  These are the
						most essential visual qualities of sculpture.
					</p>
					<p>
						Art historians usually do not write general visual
						descriptions, because they are intent upon making a
						specific argument or they are interested in a particular
						aspect of a work.  One exception is James Cahill, whose
						analyses of Chinese paintings provide exceptionally
						complete accounts of what the pictures look like.  Even
						without being interested in his scholarly purpose, any
						reader can appreciate his skill as a writer.  Typically,
						he used ordinary words to make his readers understand
						size and brush stroke as well as subject and
						composition.  His authorial voice is even and careful
						and always that of a historian, removed in time and
						place from the works in question.  At the same time,
						however, he often described what he saw in terms of how
						it must have been made.  In this way, he made a sense of
						artistic process seem like a vital part of the finished
						works.
					</p>
					<p>
						One passage by Cahill about a picture from the Ming
						period shows how he helped make his readers more
						attentive viewers.  About the ink paintings in an album
						by the painter Wang Li (Private collection and Shanghai
						Museum, China), he wrote:
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>
							The surviving leaves [of <i>Scenes of Hua-shan</i>]
							exhibit a remarkable variety in theme and
							composition .&nbsp;.&nbsp;..  [O]ne may question
							whether the actual landscape offers any such
							powerfully overhanging formations of strangely
							twisted and pitted rock as the album does.
						</p>
						<p class="mod">
							In one of the leaves, such a mass occupies almost
							the whole space of the picture, leaving only narrow
							ravines at the sides, in which travelers are visible
							on paths, climbing always upward.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. . 
							He draws in heavy lines that taper at the ends and
							thicken where they bend; it is the
							interrelationships of these bent lines, together
							with sparse texture strokes and a limited use of ink
							wash, that define the shapes of the rocks and the
							hollows in and around them.  Bushes and trees grow
							from crevices or on the tops of boulders and
							ridges.  Presenting such a massive escarpment full
							face to the viewer .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. seems to endow
							the landscape with an unearthly inner life more than
							it portrays the effects of natural geological
							processes.<a href="notes.html#n7"><sup>7</sup></a>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p class="mod">
						These few sentences suggest the landscape elements in
						the picture, the way they are arranged, what kinds of
						strokes Wang Li used, and the effect of the work on the
						viewer.
					</p>
					<p>
						Beginning with a description of the subject of the album
						as “powerfully overhanging formations of strangely
						twisted and pitted rock” gives the reader a vivid image
						to which each word has contributed.  “Powerfully”
						suggests the way in which the rocks are “overhanging”
						and “formations” suggests the idea of shapes being
						created over time.  This makes better sense after the
						next phrase, which describes the rocks as “strangely
						twisted and pitted.” All of those words allow “mass,” in
						the next sentence, to suggest a specific visual
						character.  Similarly, “heavy lines that taper at the
						ends and thicken where they bend” is made up of words
						that occur in everyday language, but they combine to
						evoke how Wang Li’s brush must have moved to deposit the
						ink as it did.  With the phrase “massive encarpment,”
						the final sentence reiterates the ideas of powerful
						formations and mass.  Then it turns in the unexpected
						direction of the painted landscape having “an unearthly
						inner life,” which suggests an entirely different
						dimension from the last phrase, “the effects of natural
						geological processes.”  Together, though, they convey a
						sense of wonder at how the picture presents its subject.
					</p>
					<p>
						A Western oil painting offers very different qualities
						to describe from a Chinese ink painting.  An exhibition
						review about Willem de Kooning's work by David Rosand
						conveys how dramatic the effect of paint and color can
						be:
					</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>
							Among the first colors to emerge from de Kooning’s
							monochrome palette of the late 1930s is a flesh
							pink.  Modulated from near neutrality to cosmetic
							blowsiness, this hue never abandons its
							significance: throughout his work, it declares
							flesh.  As de Kooning’s paint itself acquires an
							increased substance, which in turn inspires and
							provokes the aggressiveness of the brush, his
							visceral equation of impasto and flesh becomes more
							integral to his art.  This phenomenology of paint is
							most obviously realized in the <em>Woman</em> series
							(from c. 1950 inwards).&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  The
							series marks a watershed in his career: the return
							to figuration allowed the artist to acknowledge
							overtly the physiognomic basis of his painterly
							style, its source in the gestures of the
							body.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  Even as de Kooning moved
							to an imagery of abstract landscapes, individual
							strokes, gestures developed in the earlier figures,
							continue to carry by allusion and recollection their
							sense of flesh &#8211; just as the recurring pink
							proclaims flesh. . . .<a href="notes.html#n8"
								><sup>8</sup></a
							>
						</p>
					</blockquote>

					<p class="mod">
						Like Cahill, Rosand saw the physical movements of the
						painter in the work he described, but they are “gestures
						of the body” rather than the hand.  These gestures
						provide the “physiognomic basis” for de Kooning’s style,
						and create a direct connection between the figural
						subject and the presence of the artist.  Color also is
						important, the crucial “flesh pink” changing from “near
						neutrality” to “cosmetic blowsiness.”
					</p>
					<p>
						Rosand used the word “impasto” to refer to de Kooning’s
						paint.  The term, which comes from the Italian word for
						dough, refers to accumulations of paint on the surface
						of a canvas, often textured so they catch the light. 
						The technique first appeared in Venetian paintings made
						during the Renaissance, by Titian among others. 
						Rembrandt van Rijn and Vincent Van Gogh are two other
						artists famous for manipulating oil paint in this way. 
						By choosing this word, as well as describing the style
						as “painterly” (discussed in Stylistic Analysis), Rosand
						connected de Kooning to a specific tradition of Western
						painting.
