					<h3>Period Style</h3>
					<p class="mod">
						The concept of period style first appeared in the
						writings of the German scholar Johann Joachim
						Winckelmann (1717-1768). Often called the father of art
						history, Winckelmann developed a historical framework
						for Greek sculpture that was based on the way the
						objects looked. The Greeks and the Romans also had
						written about the works, but their histories and guides
						primarily discussed specific masterpieces or great
						artists. Winckelmann, on the other hand, created a
						structure that relied upon visual characteristics, which
						he defined with beautiful ekphrastic passages about
						individual sculptures.<a href="notes.html#n43"
							><sup>43</sup></a
						>
						This meant that it was possible to relate anonymous
						works about which little was known to the most famous
						art of the Ancient world.  It also meant that an
						individual object could be considered, for example, a
						late example of a style.  Date of making no longer
						determined the group in which a work was placed.
					</p>
					<p>
						At least as important as Winckelmann’s definition of
						style was his adoption of a biological model for its
						structure.  Every style has to have boundaries, places
						where it begins and ends, and Winckelmann conceived of
						these in terms of the sequence of natural growth.  Each
						style began with its birth (the early stage), progressed
						to maturity (the middle or classic phase), a decline
						(the late) and, finally, disappearance. Using this
						scheme arranges works into a very specific order and it
						is an order that implies value judgments. Early or late
						examples, which in Winckelmann’s view stand at the
						beginning or end of a style, are necessarily incomplete
						and thus imperfect. The mature, often called the
						classic, represents the fullest, the best, definition of
						the style.<a href="notes.html#n44"><sup>44</sup></a>
						This order is so common in modern art history that it is
						hard to conceive of it as the result of choices. Lang’s
						definition of style, however, explained above, reminds
						us how much this scheme too depends upon interpretation.
					</p>
					<p>
						Using variations of Winckelmann’s model, historians and
						critics have created definitions of period style for
						many other kinds of art.  One of the most important was
						developed by Heinrich Wölfflin (1864-1945) in
						<em>Principles of Art History</em>, published in German
						in 1915 and still read in English translation today. 
						Two aspects of his book have been particularly
						influential.  First is the way Wölfflin defined period
						style.  He believed that analysis of particular works of
						art would “reveal the connection of the part to the
						whole”<a href="notes.html#n45"><sup>45</sup></a> and he
						decisively rejected the “analogy of bud, bloom,
						decay.”<a href="notes.html#n46"><sup>46</sup></a> He
						created groups, not sequences, and defined their
						boundaries by opposing different uses of the same formal
						elements.  This method of analyzing by opposition and
						comparison is still the way many art historical lectures
						are organized.  Wölfflin took for granted that his
						groups were ultimately arbitrary, and discussed how many
						other ways the same material could be divided.<a
							href="notes.html#n47"
							><sup>47</sup></a
						>
					</p>
					<p>
						The specific concepts used by Wölfflin to define certain
						period styles have been very influential.  The idea of 
						“linear” versus “painterly,” linked to a fundamental
						change in the way European art from the 15th and 16th
						centuries looks compared to that from the 17th century,
						still appears in survey texts today.<a
							href="notes.html#n48"
							><sup>48</sup></a
						>
						Historians also continue to use the word “painterly.”
						The other pairs Wölfflin explained in
						<em>Principles</em> have been less influential:
						plane/recession, closed/open form, multiplicity/unity,
						and clearness/unclearness.<a href="notes.html#n49"
							><sup>49</sup></a
						>
					</p>
					<p>
						Even in translation, Wölfflin’s analyses of particular
						works of art are exceptional.  Like Winckelmann, he
						wrote about what he saw masterfully.  His application of
						the concept of the painterly to sculpture, for example,
						results in a beautiful and vivid description of Gian
						Lorenzo Bernini’s bust of Cardinal Borghese (Borghese
						Gallery, Rome):
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>
							The surfaces and folds of the garment are not only
							of their very nature restless, but are fundamentally
							envisaged with an eye to the plastically
							indeterminate. There is a flicker over the surfaces
							and the form eludes the exploring hand.  The
							highlights of the folds flash away like lizards,
							just like the highlights, heightened with white,
							which Rubens introduces into his drawings.  The
							total form is no longer seen with a view to the
							silhouette.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [The shoulders
							have] a contour which, restless in itself, at all
							points leads the eye beyond the edge [of the
							sculpture].  The same play is continued in the
							head.  Everything is arranged with a view to the
							impression of change.  It is not the open mouth
							which makes the bust baroque, but the fact that the
							shadow between the lips is regarded as something
							plastically indeterminate.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [I]t
							is fundamentally the same design that we found
							[above] in [paintings by] Frans Hals and Lievens. 
							For the transformation of the substantial into the
							unsubstantial which has only a visual reality, hair
							and eyes are in this case always especially
							characteristic.  The “look” is here obtained by
							three holes in each eye.
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p class="mod">
						Wölfflin summed up the alternative, the linear style, in
						one sentence about a portrait bust of Pietro Mellini by
						Benedetto da Majano (Museo Nazionale, Florence): “The
						essential point is that the form is enclosed in a firm
						silhouette, and that each separate form – mouth, eyes,
						the separate wrinkles – has been given an appearance of
						determinateness and immobility based on the notion of
						permanence.”<a href="notes.html#n50"><sup>50</sup></a>
					</p>
					<p>
						Through this and many other comparisons, Wölfflin argued
						for a division between the two periods, based on a
						fundamental change in the artistic style. “The whole
						notion of the pictorial has shifted.  The tactile
						picture has become the visual picture – the most
						decisive revolution which art history knows.”<a
							href="notes.html#n51"
							><sup>51</sup></a
						>
						Although he found the linear and the painterly in other
						places and periods – Impressionist painting, for
						example, was painterly &ndash; it was the movement from
						what we still call the Renaissance to the Baroque that
						interested him most deeply.
