<h3>Appendix I:  Meyer Schapiro </h3>
		<p class="mod">A collection of  passages from many writers about art provides examples of different ways of  looking, thinking, and writing. Study of only one writer, on the other hand,  allows the reader to understand a particular style of thought and  expression.  Exemplary as a writer and a  scholar, Meyer Schapiro (1904-1996) was an art historian whose work always  rewards its readers.  He analyzed art in  many ways, very often including beautiful visual descriptions to support his  historical arguments.  A Socialist, a  practicing artist, and the friend of many contemporary artists in post-war New  York, Schapiro combined rigorous scholarship with a constant sense of the  possibilities an object might suggest to an attentive viewer.   Although his academic specialty was the  medieval period, he also wrote extensively about 19th- and 20th-century  art.  He summarized his interests this  way:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p> The study of  art history presupposes that art is a universal and permanent feature of civilized  life and that what we do to preserve it, and to discriminate the best of it,  will contribute to future enjoyment as much as to our own&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Our concern with  the work of art, however touched by vanity or greed, is a homage beyond  self-interest. Through it we surmount, if only at rare moments, the limitations  of our striving, possessive selves and, as an old poet says, ‘into glory peep’.<a href="#n1" title=""><sup>1</sup></a></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="mod">Below are a few  paragraphs from his writings, annotated with some comments about the context in  which they originally appeared and editorial remarks.  I have omitted references to plates and the  numbers of the notes, and added the location of works he mentioned.</p>
		<p> The following passage is about  Vincent Van Gogh’s <em>Wheat Field with Cypresses</em> (National Gallery,  London), painted in 1889, another version of the work of the same name in the  Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. Schapiro wrote this description to accompany a full-page  reproduction of the painting.  Thus he  could assume that the reader had some idea of what the work looked like.  Nonetheless, the basic elements of the  picture quickly become clear from his words alone.</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p> Although  restless beyond measure, with few straight lines, this landscape is one of the  most classic in conception among van Gogh’s works.  It is built up in great bands that traverse  the entire space.  The tall dark cypress  trees at one side offer a powerful contrast to the prevailing horizontals,  which they resemble in form.  The  opposition of warm and cool, the proportioning of the parts, the relative  height of sky and earth on the two sides, the horizontal intervals which we can  measure on the silhouette of the distant mountains, twice broken by trees &ndash; all  these are perfectly legible and well-balanced.</p>
		<p class="mod"> It is a landscape in which the  painter’s perception of nature and his intensity of feeling are equally  pronounced.  The glowing wheat field, the  olive trees of subtle grey in which all the colours of the picture seem to be  mingled, the shaggy wavering cypresses, and the turbulent mountains, have been  wonderfully observed, and the light that fills this space has a vivid actuality  for our eyes.  The brightness emanating  from the cold sky and the warm earth is realized as much through the local  colours as through the play of light and shadow &ndash; van Gogh is free with the  latter, and hardly aims at consistency on this point.</p>
		<p class="mod"> It is mainly in the sky that his  stormy emotion begets strange shapes, which carry us beyond nature.  These contorted, monstrous forms, twisted,  coiling, in places congested and unclear, evoke images of supernatural  combats.  The soft blues, lilacs, whites  and greenish tones of this sky are repeated in lesser mass in the earthy  landscape below, and the fantastic heavens are finally absorbed into the  familiar, natural world.  The latter,  too, is pervaded by wild energies, demanding release; but these do not deform  the objects so much as they intensify them.   Here the impulsive ecstatic brush, marvellous in its fluency, is  faithful to the structure of objects.</p>
		<p class="mod"> The duality of sky and earth  remains – the first light, soft, rounded, filled with fantasy and suggestions of  animal forms, the earth firmer, harder, more intense in colour, with stronger  contrasts, of more distinct parts, perhaps masculine.  Or one might interpret the duality as of the  real and the vaguely desired and imagined.   Connecting them is the single vertical, the cypress trees, as in <i>The  Starry Night</i> [Museum of Modern Art, New York], of which this painting is in  other ways the diurnal counterpart.<a href="#n2" title=""><sup>2</sup></a></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="mod">Notice how the  “strange shapes” of the landscape are linked to Van Gogh’s “stormy  emotions.”  As discussed above, not all  historians would agree with this assumption that Van Gogh’s style reveals his  mental state.  The visual qualities of  the “strange shapes” can be separated from Schapiro’s interpretation of them,  however, leaving the rest of the description perfectly comprehensible.  His suggestion of the earth as a “masculine”  quantity, a description that would not be regarded as useful today, also can be  rephrased or removed without hurting the whole.</p>
		<p> Schapiro wrote iconographic studies,  especially of medieval art, explaining the meaning of works in terms of  symbolism or tradition.  He also  addressed questions of meaning in 19th- and 20th-century  art, where the artist and the art seem to be less closely tied to the society  in which they worked and visual meaning sometimes has to be found outside of  contemporary conventions.  The  Impressionists or the Cubists did not exist in an equivalent of the religious  context in which most medieval art was produced.  Nonetheless, Schapiro argued that intimate  historical relationships could be found, even for apparently unremarkable  descriptions of actual things or places.   This is his argument in an analysis of Georges Seurat’s painting of the  Eiffel Tower (The Fine Arts Museums, San Francisco):</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p> In painting the  [Eiffel] Tower in 1889, even before it was completed, Seurat took a stand on an  object of intense dispute among artists of the time.  The enemies of the Tower included writers  like Huysmans who saw in it only the <em>Notre  Dame de la Brocante </em>&#8211; a vulgar assertion of the power of industry and  trade.  For Seurat the tower was a  congenial work of art of which he had anticipated the forms in his own  painting.  Its clean, graceful silhouette  has an unmistakable affinity with the lines of the trombonist in his <em>Side Show</em> and the central nude of the <em>Models</em>.   Besides, the construction of this immense monument out of small exposed  parts, each designed for its place, and forming together out of the visible  criss-cross and multiplicity of elements a single airy whole of striking  simplicity and elegance of shape, was not unlike his own art with its summation  of innumerable tiny units into a large clear form which retained the aspect of  immaterial lightness evident in the smaller parts.  In its original state the Tower was closer to  Seurat’s art than it is today; for the iron structure was coated with several  shades of iridescent enamel paint – the poet Tailhade called it the  “speculum-Eiffel.”  If the identity of  the painter of Seurat’s pictures were unknown, we would call him appropriately  the Master of the Eiffel Tower. </p>
		<p class="mod"> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He is the first modern painter  who expressed in the basic fabric and forms of his art an appreciation of the  beauty of modern techniques.  In  Pissarro’s and Monet’s paintings of related themes, a haze of atmosphere and  smoke veils the structure of the boats and the bridges, and the simple lines of  the engineers’ forms are lost in the picturesqueness of irregular masses and  patches of color.  Seurat, in his sympathetic  vision of the mechanical in the constructed environment, is a forerunner of an  important current in the architecture and painting of the twentieth century.<a href="#n3" title=""><sup>3</sup></a></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>			Schapiro wrote his Ph.D.  dissertation about the style of the Romanesque sculpture at the Abbey Church of  St.-Pierre in Moissac, France (Ph.D., Columbia University, 1929).  The first section of it appeared in <em>Art Bulletin</em> in 1931 and was included in <em>  Romanesque Art</em>.<em> Selected Papers. </em>Since  Schapiro’s subject was style, or what he defined as “my sense of the character  of the whole and the relevance of the parts to it,” the work contains many passages of visual description.<a href="#n4"title=""><sup>4</sup></a>  About the apostles carved in relief on the  piers in the cloister of the church he wrote:</p>
		<blockquote><p> The head is a diagram of its  separate features.  The flow of facial  surface is extremely gentle; prominences are suppressed and transitions  smoothed.  Each hair is rendered  separately, and bunches of hair or locks form regular spiral, wavy, or  imbricated units that are repeated in parallel succession.  The eyebrow is a precise arched line, without  relief, formed by the meeting of the two surfaces.</p>
		<p class="mod"> The eye itself is an arbitrary  composition, a regular object of distinct parts, in simple relation, none  encroaching on the next.  The lids are  treated as two equal, separate members without junction or overlapping.  They form an ellipsoid figure of which the  upper arc is sometimes of larger radius than the lower, contrary to nature.  In some figures .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the eyeball is a smooth  unmarked surface with no indication of iris or pupil.  In others .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. an incised circle defines the  iris.  The inner corner of the eye is not  observed at all.</p>
		<p class="mod"> The mouth shows an equal  simplicity.  The fine breaks and curves,  the hollows and prominences which determine expression and distinguish  individuals, are hardly marked.  A common  formula is employed here.  The two lips  are equal and quite similar.  Their parting  line is straight or very slightly curved, but sharply drawn.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
		<p class="mod"> The drapery  forms are as schematic as the eyes and hair.   The lower horizontal edge of the tunics of these figures is broken in  places by a small unit, usually pentagonal in outline, which represents the  lower end of the fluting formed at the base of a vertical fold, or the pleating  of a horizontal border.  In its actual  shape it corresponds to nothing in the structure of drapery, unless we presume  that a wind from below has stirred the garment at certain points into this  strange schematic fold, and that another force has flattened it against the  body.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
		<p class="mod"> We are not surprised to find such  forms on figures whose feet hang and whose eyes stare at us even when the face  is turned in profile, and whose hands can perform only those gestures which  permit us to see their full surface.  The  elevation or vertical projection of the fold derives from the same habit of  mind that gives to objects incompletely apprehended in nature an unmistakable  completeness in images.  The fold is  freed of the accidents of bodily movement and currents which makes drapery an  unstable system of lines, and is designed instead as a rigid geometrical  element.  Rather than evoking the free  and sporadic appearance of nature, it is further limited, when multiplied, to a  few symmetrically arrayed lines.</p>
		<p class="mod"> Similar observations may be made of  hands and feet, of the structure of the whole body, and even of the ornaments  of the reliefs, the rosettes of the spandrels, and the foliage of the little  capitals.<a href="#n5" title=""><sup>5</sup></a> </p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="mod">About the handling of the  drapery of the figures on the tympanum he wrote:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>In the drapery  of a Gothic or more recent sculpture, single folds are inseparable from the  whole; they are more plastic than the Romanesque and mingle in such a way that  whatever their patterning and linear organization they are perceived at once as  parts of a common structure.  We can  trace no groove without observing the influence of neighboring forms on its  expansion and movement; its origin is usually indefinite or vague.  On the early Romanesque figures, folds may be  more readily isolated, despite their apparent complexity.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  The drapery resembles in this respect the forms of the figure  itself.  Just as eyes, nose, and lips are  separate elements compounded to form the whole, so the folds are  distinguishable entities on the costume, no matter how involved and contrasted.  This point, which seems obvious, is worth  making since it confirms the pervasive character of the processes of  representation and the style, whether occupied with animate or inanimate  things.<a href="#n6" title=""><sup>6</sup></a> </p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Schapiro  was deeply engaged in the art of his time.   He supported contemporary art in many ways, not  least by writing about it.  In “Nature of  Abstract Art,” an article published in 1937, Schapiro disputed the conception  of modern art presented by Alfred Barr and, through him, The Museum of Modern  Art:</p>
		<blockquote><p>[Even if <em>Cubism  and Abstract Art</em>]  is largely an  account of historical movements, Barr’s conception of abstract art remains  essentially unhistorical.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  He  excludes as irrelevant to its history the nature of the society in which it  arose, except as an incidental obstructing or accelerating atmospheric  factor.  The history of modern art is  presented as an internal, immanent process among the artists.<a href="#n7" title=""><sup>7</sup></a></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="mod">Arguing that  abstract art had as profound and intimate a connection to its historical  context as representational art, Schapiro described some of the ways in which  this might be so:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p> In renouncing  or drastically distorting natural shapes the abstract painter makes a judgment  of the external world.  He says that such  and such aspects of experience are alien to art and to the higher realities of  form; he disqualifies them from art.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.   The values that underlie or that follow today from such attitudes  suggest new formal problems, just as the secular interests of the later middle  ages made possible a whole series of new formal types of space and the human  figure.  The qualities of cryptic  improvisation, the microscopic intimacy of textures, points and lines, the  impulsively scribbled forms, the mechanical precision in constructing  irreducible, incommensurable fields, the thousand and one ingenious formal  devices of dissolution, penetration, immateriality and incompleteness, which  affirm the abstract artist’s active sovereignty over objects, these and many  other sides of modern art are discovered experimentally by painters who seek  freedom outside of nature and society and consciously negate the formal aspects  of perception – like the connectedness of shape and color or the practical  discontinuity of object and surroundings – that enter into the practical  relations of man in nature.<a href="#n8" title=""><sup>8</sup></a> </p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="mod">Schapiro’s easy reference to the  late medieval period, like his humorous renaming of Seurat as the Master of the Eiffel Tower,  as if he were a manuscript painter, shows the way in which he drew upon all of his knowledge,  all of the time.  His descriptions of how  abstract art might look are startling anticipations  of the appearance of works produced decades later.</p>
		<p> Schapiro  conceived of modern art and its relation to society in the same large terms  he used for older  art.  Thus he compared the forms of  abstract art with “the abstract devices in Renaissance  art, especially the systems of perspective and the canon of proportion, which are today  misunderstood as merely imitative means.”<a href="#n9" title=""><sup>9</sup></a>  In the end, he argued,</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>[T]he movement  of abstract art is too comprehensive and long-prepared, too closely related to  similar movements in literature and philosophy, which have quite other  technical conditions, and finally, too varied according to time and place, to  be considered a self-contained development issuing by a kind of internal logic  directly from aesthetic problems.  It  bears within itself at almost every point the mark of the changing material and  psychological conditions surrounding modern culture.</p>
		<p class="mod"> The avowals of artists .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. show  that the step to abstraction was accompanied by great tension and emotional  excitement.  The painters justify  themselves by ethical and metaphysical standpoints, or in defense of their art  attack the preceding style as the counterpart of a detested social or moral  position.  Not the processes of imitating  nature were exhausted, but the valuation of nature itself had changed.  The philosophy of art was also a philosophy  of life.<a href="#n10" title=""><sup>10</sup></a></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="mod">The last sentence could apply to  Schapiro’s career as well: his philosophy of art was his philosophy of life.  The richness, the variety, the complexity, of  the ways in which art could be related to life was the  principle that informed all of his work, regardless of its subject.</p>
