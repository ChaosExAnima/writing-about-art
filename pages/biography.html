		<h3>The Biography</h3>
		<p class="mod">Although  visual and stylistic analyses are fundamental to the practice of art history,  the most familiar way of grouping art is by artist.  The relationship is so close that common  English usage drops the “by” in “a painting by Manet,” so that it becomes “a  Manet painting” or even “a Manet.”  In  the last, only the small word “a” indicates that the “Manet” being discussed is  an object rather than a person.  This  assumption of an intimate and important connection between the maker and the  made has very practical implications.  It  rests on the belief that the actual historical person matters, the person who  was born on a certain day and died on another.   Exactly how and why the person matters is what determines how and why  the life is important.  This, in turn,  will determine the questions considered in a biography.  Like all assumptions of critical analysis,  biographical ones should be examined closely.</p>
		<p> The identity of the artist has been  regarded as one of the most important facts about a work of art for centuries  in the West.  Beginning with the Greeks,  names of great artists have seemed to be worth recording, and stories about  them exist even when their works do not.   Pliny the Elder and Pausanias, two Romans whose writings are among the  richest sources of information about Greek art, approached their subjects as  today’s art historians do &ndash; from the distance of centuries, gathering what was said in older sources without necessarily having  seen the original works.<a href="notes.html#n52"><sup>52</sup></a> The first history of art in the post-Classical world, Giorgio Vasari’s <em>Lives  of the Artists</em>, published in Italy in the mid-16th century, also organizes  the art in terms of the biographies of its makers.  Since Vasari was a contemporary or  near-contemporary of the artists, his vivid anecdotes suggest the authority of  personal knowledge.<a href="notes.html#n53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
		<p> Even assuming that the identity of  the artist is an essential part of understanding a work of art, however, different  artists suggest different questions, and different historians write very  different kinds of studies.  For one  scholar, the artist’s life consists of an orderly succession of opportunities  and achievements, with his or her relationship to the works determined by  conscious choices made in response to external events.  For another, perhaps even writing about the  same person, every scrap of work reveals the genius of the artist, and  obstacles that have been surmounted demonstrate the power of the person’s  talent.  Unfinished works may seem more  important than finished ones, because they suggest a more immediate access to  the creative process.  In a  psychoanalytical biography, all of the work is thought to reveal the  unconscious, just as dreams do.</p>
		<p>The same artist always can be  studied from different points of view, but some present the historian with  especially dramatic choices.  The life  and work of Vincent van Gogh have seemed to many to be especially close,  his art an expression of the deepest truths about his innermost self.  Most historians have presented Van Gogh as  the quintessential troubled genius, beset by mental illness and constantly  undermined by loneliness and financial difficulties.  Individual works are seen as illustrations of  the artist’s emotional distress, with space that recedes too rapidly or tilts  unexpectedly indicating mental imbalance, while twisted trees and dark  foreboding cypresses reveal his melancholy.   Furthermore, because the most famous works look so different from those  by his contemporaries, the pictures seem to be without debt to a conventional  artistic education or established masters.<a href="notes.html#n54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
		<p> In <em>Ways of Seeing</em>, John  Berger pointed out how profoundly our knowledge of Van Gogh’s death from a  self-inflicted gunshot wound influences the way we see his art.  On one page of his book, above a small  black-and-white reproduction of <em>Crows over Wheat Fields</em> (Van Gogh Museum,  Amsterdam), Berger wrote “This is a landscape of a cornfield with birds flying  out of it.  Look at it for a moment.  Then turn the page.”  The reader turns the page to find the same  reproduction, but with an italicized, apparently handwritten caption beneath  it: “<em>This is the last picture that Van  Gogh painted before he killed himself</em>.”   Then, in a new paragraph, the text continues in the typeface used  throughout the book: “It is hard to define exactly how the words have changed  the image but undoubtedly they have.  The  image now illustrates the sentence.”<a href="notes.html#n55"><sup>55</sup></a> In fact, the belief that Van Gogh was working on this particular painting when he shot  himself has become the basis of almost everyone’s response to it, influencing  explanations of the subject as well as the technique.</p>
		<p> In her monograph about Van Gogh,  Judy Sund tried to understand <em>Crows over Wheat Fields</em> as a work of art  rather than as a revelation of inner life.   She built her interpretation on Van Gogh’s own words, taken from   the many letters by him that survive.  In  early July of 1890, writing about tensions that made him feel as if his life  were “threatened at the very root,” he began to paint “vast fields of wheat  under troubled skies.”  Sund discussed  these pictures:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>The  artist wrote .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of painting two ‘big canvases’ in this vein, and it is  generally agreed that [<em>Wheat Field under Clouded Sky</em> (Van Gogh Museum,  Amsterdam) is one of them and] the famed <em>Crows over Wheat Fields</em> is the  other.  Often romanticized as Van Gogh’s  last painting (which it almost certainly was not), <em>Crows</em> has been read  as a virtual suicide note – its blackening sky and flock of dark birds taken for  portents of his imminent death.  Though  Van Gogh would, in fact, shoot himself in a wheat field at the end of July, he  probably had no plan to do so when he painted <em>Crows</em>, a vibrantly hued  and lushly textured picture.  Indeed, the  artist felt that, despite their sad and lonely tenor, his vistas of wheat under  heavy skies were visually expressive of something he had trouble describing  verbally:  a sense of ‘the health and  fortifying forces I see in the country.’  </p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="mod">After  this linking of the artist’s own words with his painting, Sund considered other  letters by Van  Gogh to situate the picture in the larger context of his work:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p> Despite <em>Crows</em>’s turbulent weather and low-flying birds, [it represents] the  spectacle of a mature crop .&nbsp;.&nbsp;..   Enraptured by the allusive connotations of the rural work cycle, [Van  Gogh] .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. took comfort in the glimpses of a grand schema (‘the infinite’)  that nature’s cycles afforded.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  It  is also probable that Van Gogh related the swooping birds .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to the sinister  forces that undermine the efforts of the [Biblical] parable’s sower .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  <em>Crows </em>would seem to proclaim the  defeat of those agents of evil, since birds cannot harm a crop that stands  ready to be reaped.<a href="notes.html#n56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="mod">In  other words, separated from biographical legend and fit to Van Gogh’s own sense  of landscape, <em>Crows</em> becomes an affirmation of life in its subject as  much as in its composition, colors, and brush strokes.</p>
		<p> Artemisia Gentileschi is another  artist who offers historians a dramatic choice about how to connect her life to  her art.  Gentileschi learned to paint in  the studio of her father.  In May of  1612, when Gentileschi was 19, her father sued an assistant named Agostino  Tassi for raping his daughter.  Tassi had  been hired to teach her perspective and, according to court documents, had  raped her in May of the previous year.   After a lengthy trial, during the course of which Gentileschi was  tortured to discover whether the allegation was true, Tassi fled from Rome while Gentileschi  married someone else and moved to Florence.   She went on to have a successful career as a painter in Italy and  England.<a href="notes.html#n57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
		<p> Mary Garrard wrote a monograph about  Gentileschi in which she considered the artist in terms of issues raised by her  gender.  She argued that Gentileschi’s  major figure paintings of Biblical and Classical heroines should be read, at  least in part, as expressions of the personal feelings of the artist.  For example, Gentileschi’s <em>Susannah and  the Elders</em> (Collection Graf von Schoenborn, Pommersfelden), which depicts a  subject popular among artists at the time, presents:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p> a  reflection, not of the rape itself, but rather of how one young woman felt  about her own sexual vulnerability in the year 1610.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  <em>Susannah</em> does not express the violence  of rape, but the intimidating pressure of the threat of rape.  Artemisia’s response to the rape itself is  more probably reflected in her earliest interpretation of the Judith theme, the  dark and bloody <em>Judith Slaying Holofernes</em> [(Uffizi, Florence)] . .  .  Once we acknowledge, as we must, that  Artemisia Gentileschi’s early pictures are vehicles of personal expression to  an extraordinary degree, we can trace the progress of her experience, as the  victim first of sexual intimidation, and then rape &#8211; two phases of a continuous  sequence that find their pictorial counterparts in .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <em>Susannah</em> and .  . . <em>Judith</em> respectively.<a href="notes.html#n58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Griselda Pollock argued against  Garrard’s interpretation of Gentileschi’s <em>Susannah and the Elders</em> as a  form of autobiography:</p>
		<blockquote><p> [Garrard’s]  reading of <em>Susannah and the Elders</em>, of the awkwardly twisting, and  distressingly exposed body, surmounted by the anguished face in the painting  that places us so close to the vulnerability of the naked woman with the men so  menacingly near, is true to what we now see.   But how do we understand what we are seeing, historically?</p></blockquote>
		<p class="mod">Just  as Sund placed Van Gogh’s <em>Crows</em> in the context of the artist’s own  words, so Pollock tried to understand what <em>Susannah</em> might have meant to  a viewer in Italy in 1610:  </p>
		<blockquote>
			<p> There  is an excess in the nude body, in its sharp body-creasing twist, the flung-out  hands, the taut neck and the downcast head.   The face of Susannah is also disturbing.   Its expressive tenor is pitched almost too high and its position draws  it away from the body, creating distinct registers of representation.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  These elements of pose, gesture and facial expression, the grammar of  historical painting bequeathed by the High Renaissance Academy, endow the  female body that is the luminous centre of the painting with an energy, a  pathos and a subjectivity that does indeed run counter to the figuration of the  female nude on display .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  That shift  in effect is not, I would suggest, the result of Artemisia Gentileschi’s  knowing intention or her experience.  The  painting might suggest the tentative beginning of a possible grammar, arising  out of inexperience as an artist, resulting from difficulties in resolving the  integration of elements and of managing space as a narrative device.<a href="notes.html#n59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="mod">In  Pollock’s view, then, the painting describes a popular subject, depicted by an  artist
			who  was not yet able to manipulate all of the pictorial elements needed for a large  figural composition.  The awkwardness and  twisting of Susannah's body is connected to Gentilischi's life, but by  representing a stage in her artistic development, not her personal experience.</p>
		<p>The  examples of Van Gogh and Gentileschi may seem too extreme to be very revealing  for ordinary art historical writing, never mind student papers.  Nonetheless, they demonstrate how assumptions  about the relationship between the life of the artist and his or her art can  change the way the art is interpreted.   Even a decision as simple as studying only one period in an artist’s  career has consequences.  Whether  intended or not, it separates some of the work from the rest, and does so using  the artist’s life to define the group.   That such choices are made by art historians all the time is  unavoidable, but they must be understood as choices.  Objects do not come labeled this way.		</p>
