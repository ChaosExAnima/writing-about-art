<h3><strong>APPENDIX I:  WRITING  THE PAPER</strong>  <br />
		</h3>
		<p><strong>The Writing Process:</strong> <br /> 
		</p><p>1. <em>Know what  the assignment is!</em>  The 19th century is not the  same as the 1900s and a painting is not a sculpture.  Read the  assignment carefully and ask questions before you begin work.   Always, always, check the due date and plan your life accordingly. <br /> 
		</p><p>2. If the subject of the paper  is a work in a museum, <em>go to the museum as soon as possible</em>.   This is not the same as checking the website.  It means actually  going and looking at what has been assigned.  Regardless of the  topic, make sure you know everything about the relevant works as physical  objects.  This includes size and the materials used.  Other  questions may be important.  For example, if it is a sculpture,  does it have one point of view that is primary?  Is there one place  from which everything makes sense?  If it is a painting, is there  an ideal viewing distance?  What happens when you get closer or  move farther away?  You should consider these questions even if  you are not able to see the original works.   <br /> 
		</p><p>3. <em>Write down all your visual  observations</em>.  Don’t worry about putting them in order.   The most important thing is to notice as much as you can, and take notes  that will make sense to you later.  Remember, a reproduction is  not the same as the work of art it reproduces.  If you are not  able to see the original, you must take this into account.  For  example, if the original object is two dimensional, make sure that the  reproduction does not crop the edges of the original. If it is three  dimensional, make sure that you see as many different points of view  as you can. <br />
		</p><p>4. If your assignment is a visual  analysis, your notes will become the basis of the finished paper.   Organize them in a way that will make sense to someone who has not seen  the work.  The groupings you create should form an outline of what  you want to say, with each group becoming a paragraph.  If a paragraph  is very long, if it even comes close to being a full page of text, separate  the material into several paragraphs.  When you have finished a  complete draft, check the topic sentences of each paragraph. Sometimes  it is easiest to write the topic sentence last, fitting it to the paragraph  you have written. <br />
		</p><p>5. Even a research paper must  begin with careful visual observations.  They will determine the  direction of your research.  Once you have identified the questions  you wish to study, you should begin looking for relevant material  (see below, The Research Process).<strong>  </strong> Remember to <em>check the assignment </em> to see if you are supposed to use certain kinds of sources or a certain  number of them.  You must begin looking as soon as possible because it is <em> very unlikely</em> that everything you need will be available online.   <br /> 
		</p><p>6.  <strong>PLAGIARISM</strong>.   Once you begin your research, you must keep track of your sources and  exactly what each one said.  <strong>Plagiarism occurs when you use  someone else’s words or someone else’s ideas without indicating  the source</strong>.  Changing individual words in someone else’s  text, even changing every word in the relevant passage, and not citing  the source is still plagiarism. You have stolen the idea even if you  haven’t used the same phrases to express it.  This can happen  by accident if you have not kept good notes, because you can’t be  sure of where you read what.  Make sure you record all bibliographic information (see <a href="appendix3.html">Appendix III: Citation Forms</a>), including exact pages and addresses of websites so you will be able to cite  things properly. <br />
		</p><p>7.  Even before you have  assembled everything you need, you should begin to outline your paper.   It is only by actually using the material you have that you will discover  what is missing.  Ideally, you will have the time to find what  you need to know.  This will not be possible if you have waited  until the last minute to complete the assignment.   <br /> 
		</p><p>8.  Any paper, no matter  what its length, must have a structure.  The unit of an essay is  the paragraph, which presents the material on a single subject in a  logical order.  It must begin with a topic sentence, which states  the subject to be discussed.  Underline your topic sentences and  see if they make an outline of your paper.  They should.   Then make sure that the paragraph really is about the subject of the  topic sentence.  You may have written a fine paragraph, but not  one that fits the topic sentence.  Keep the paragraph and change  the first sentence.  Or keep the topic sentence and fit it to a  new paragraph. <br />
		</p><p>9.  A long paper should  have an introduction, several paragraphs about the subject of the paper,  and a conclusion.  A short paper need not have a formal introduction  and conclusion.  In all cases, however, the first sentence or sentences  must tell the reader what the subject of the paper is.  If the  paper is an analysis of a work of art, give the basic visual information  about the work right away.  Even a beautifully written paper will  not make sense to a reader if the subject is not clear.   <br /> 
		</p><p>10.  A direct quotation from  either a primary source or a secondary source can change the pace of  the writing or explain an idea more vividly than a paraphrase would.   If it is part of the text, it must be in quotation marks.  If it  will run more than a few lines in the text, it should be single-spaced  and set off as a single block, indented five spaces from the margin.   The note indicating the source should come after the period at the end  of the quotation. <br />
		</p><p>11.  You must give references  to your sources in a consistent and comprehensible way, so that a reader  can go to the exact place you found your information. Remember: <em>the  forms for both footnotes and endnotes  are different from those used in a bibliography</em>. Most art historians  use the Humanities version of the Chicago Manual Style.  Correct  citation forms for notes and bibliography in this style are given in  <a href="appendix3.html">Appendix III</a>. <br />  <br />
		</p><p><strong> The Research Process:</strong> <br />
		</p><p>1.  First<em>, know what  your topic is!</em>  Ideally, you  should know what visual  material is relevant to your topic, looked at it carefully, and decided  which aspects interest you <em>before</em> you begin your  research.  Not all topics are equally  promising and not all questions are equally useful.  If you are  writing a five-page paper about a major artist, you are likely to be  overwhelmed with sources, and your greatest problem will be defining  a thesis that can be discussed in a short essay.  If it is an obscure  topic or a single work of art, on the other hand, you may have difficulty  finding any sources at all.  Best is to have a few possibilities  so you can change your topic if you discover you have reached a dead-end. <br /> 
		</p><p style="padding-bottom:0px">2.  Once you have a topic,  you must select appropriate <strong>search terms</strong>. The more specifically  the terms relate to your topic the better.  If you are writing  about Claude Monet's paintings, you should limit your searches to his  name, perhaps in combination with other relevant aspects of his work.   Do not expand it to &quot;French 19th-century painting&quot; or even  &quot;Impressionism&quot;, both of which will produce an overwhelming  number of references.  A helpful website for searches, especially using  Google, is <a href="http://hcl.harvard.edu/research/guides/google/index.html">http://hcl.harvard.edu/research/guides/google/index.html</a>.   See Parts 3 and 4 especially.  <br />
		</p><p>The most useful search terms  may depend upon how the particular catalogue or database you are using  works.  Most will look for exactly what you have entered (check  for spelling mistakes!).  Usually you can search for an exact phrase  by putting it in quotation marks.  In other places, you have to  put AND between the individual words.  Library catalogues distinguish  between a &quot;<strong>keyword</strong>&quot; and a &quot;<strong>subject</strong>.&quot;   A &quot;keyword&quot; is one that appears anywhere in the data about  the source &#8211; the title as well as the categories under which it has  been catalogued.  &quot;Subject&quot; refers to specific words  that have been chosen by the Library of Congress in Washington, DC,  as Subject Headings.  Therefore it is better to start with keywords.  <br /> 
		</p><p>3.  You must understand  the basic types of resources that are available.  The most important  are <strong>books</strong>, <strong>journal</strong> <strong>articles</strong> (journals also are  called periodicals, serials, or magazines), and <strong>websites</strong>.   Books and journal articles also may be available in electronic form  on the web or in your library (see below, 5, 6, and 7). Especially if  you are looking at these things online, you may not be sure which is  which.  A normal <strong>book</strong> has one or more authors or editors,  a title, a publisher, and a date of publication. If you are looking  at the actual work or a scan of it, check for a title page (which usually  gives the title, the author, and the publisher) and a copyright page  (usually on the back of the title page, and often lists the same information,  but with the addition of the date of publication after the copyright  symbol).  A <strong>journal</strong> comes out periodically (hence the name  periodical or serial), and thus will have a volume and date in addition  to its title.  Since the article you are using is likely only one of  many published in the same issue or in the same year, you must give  the page numbers on which it appears as well as the name of the author,  the article, the periodical, its volume, and its date.  A <strong>website</strong>  is identified by a stable URL or web address.  The best way to  see if you have the correct address is to paste the URL into a new browser  window and see if it takes you to your source.  If it doesn't,  you don’t have the correct information and you should check your source  again.  Many scholarly websites now include instructions about  citation somewhere on the page.  With all websites, you should  give the date on which you used the site, because it may have changed  or even vanished by the time a reader tries to find your source.  <br /> 
		</p><p style="padding-bottom:0px">4.  There are two places  to begin your research:  the Internet and the library.  The <strong> Internet</strong> is probably a better place to start.  It is easily  accessible, up-to-date, and can lead you to excellent resources.   It must be used with care however, since much of the information found  online is wrong &#8211; on any topic, not just art history.  You will  start by using a <strong>search engine</strong>, of which Google is the most popular,  to find references to your topic.  Note that Google is not a source  in itself, but only a way to find sources.  Its URL, <a href="http://www.google.com">www.google.com</a>,  only provides a homepage with a bar into which you enter a search term,  not any actual information.  Using mathematical algorithms, Google  sorts through all the information on the Internet that it has indexed,  and provides a list of the sites its calculations suggest will be most  useful to you.  Since different search terms will provide different  lists, you should enter as many as possible to make sure that you have  found the most relevant sources.  You also should read beyond the  first page of results, because the order created by the search engine  may not correspond to your needs.   
		</p><p>Search engines rank sites by  a variety of factors, including how many times people have linked to  them.  This means that the open-edit, online encyclopedia <strong>Wikipedia</strong>  almost always appears at the top because of its immense popularity.   As a source of casual, especially topical, information, it is often  very useful.  As a reliable research source, however, it has serious  problems.  The most important of them is the feature that makes  it as dynamic and successful as it is:  the fact that it is open-edit.   This means that anyone with an Internet connection can change articles.   A history of the edits to any given article can be found if you click  on the tab called History at the top of the page.  Unfortunately,  you have no idea who the people are or where they got their information.   Although sometimes a source is given (linked to the small number in  brackets), more often there is not one.  As a result, Wikipedia  is a great place to begin, but should not be used as the final source  for any information.  It is a collection of facts and pictures  that may be very helpful, and it may contain references to other sources  where you will be able to assess the reliability of the information  given. <br />
		</p><p style="padding-bottom:0px">5.  Deciding <strong>which  websites are reliable</strong> is hard even for an experienced researcher.  Generally speaking, the ones with URLs that end in .org (often a non-profit  organization), .edu (an educational institution), and .gov (or government)  are better than ones that end in .com (commercial), but this is not  always the case.  Being able to find the name of the person who  wrote an article is helpful, because then you can search the author's  name online and see if he or she has written scholarly books or articles  that have been cited by other people.  You also should check whether  all the facts correspond to those you find in places known to be reliable  (see below).  This last might be misleading, however, since sometimes  people repeat the same incorrect fact again and again, each having gotten  it from someone who wrote earlier rather than checking the original  source.  Additional suggestions can be found at <a href="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/TeachingLib/Guides/Internet/Evaluate.html">http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/TeachingLib/Guides/Internet/Evaluate.html</a>.    
		</p><p>The easiest way to deal with  the problem of reliability is to begin your research with websites you  can trust.  The website of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, <strong><a href="http://www.metmuseum.org">www.metmuseum.org</a></strong>,  which is available to anyone, has information about many of the works  in its own immense collection, some of which will almost certainly be  relevant to your topic.  It also has the <em>Heilbrunn Timeline  of Art History</em>, found through a link on the museum's homepage, which  contains maps, timelines, and thematic essays on a wide range of subjects.  Anything on the museum's site contains reliable information that has  been reviewed by authorities in the field.  Make sure you do multiple  searches, checking &quot;Entire Site&quot; as well as &quot;Works of  Art,&quot; and &quot;Timeline of Art History&quot; (a category under  &quot;What's Online&quot; in a list given above the search box), using  as many different terms as possible.  Entering a broad search term  does not necessarily provide links to all the relevant resources. <br /> 
		</p><p style="padding-bottom:0px">6.  Many of the best sources  can be found in subscriber-only databases, which you will have to use  through a library. The best place to start for an art historical topic  is <strong><em>Oxford Art Online</em></strong>, which contains thousands of signed  articles, almost all of which end with a bibliography. This means that  you likely will find not only information but also references to other  authoritative sources.  <em>Oxford Art Online </em> is really a collection of different reference works, which include the  34 volume <em>Grove Dictionary of Art</em> published in 1996, and the  4 volume <em>Encyclopedia of Aesthetics</em>, published in 1998.   Be aware that <em>Grove Art Online</em> is greatly updated and expanded  compared to the published work.  Therefore the online version is  more useful than the print version.  As always with articles on  the Internet, the date you accessed it should be included whenever you  refer to it. <br />
		</p><p>There also are a number of <strong> scholarly journal databases</strong> that contain articles scanned from print  periodicals. These include Academic Search Premier, Art Full Text, EBSCOhost,  JSTOR, and Project Muse.  In almost all cases, however, they do  not include articles that have appeared during the past couple of years,  so make sure you check to see how recent the references will be.   Anything available on these databases originally appeared in print and  thus counts as a printed source, since you would read exactly the same  thing in the magazine found on a library's shelf as you do in the database.   Therefore the correct citation should include only the information that  is necessary to find it in either place:  the author, the title,  the name, volume, and date of the periodical, and the page numbers.   The name of the database is no more or less relevant than the name of  the library, since both are just places to find the article. <br /> 
		</p><p style="padding-bottom:0px">7.  In addition to being  an immensely powerful search engine, Google<strong> </strong> has two special features, called <strong>Google Scholar</strong> and <strong>Google  Books. </strong> These are found if you click on &quot;more&quot; among the  tabs at the top of the homepage.  <strong>Google Scholar</strong> directs you to  articles about the search term you entered<strong>,</strong> although it does  not provide links to them. As always, use as many search terms as possible,  and remember, the terms have to be specific to produce manageable results.   Some of the sources you will be able to access directly on the Internet,  while others will be in subscriber-only databases.  The reference  will give you that information most of the time.  One great advantage  of Google Scholar is that it includes very recent sources, which allows  you to find things that might not turn up on searches of subscriber-only  databases. 
		</p><p style="padding-bottom:0px"><strong>Google Books </strong> is part of an immense undertaking by Google to scan every book ever  published.  Recent publications usually are not available for viewing  although their names do come up as search results, and sometimes you  can get a limited preview of a few pages.  This might be all you  need.  Google Books also makes available the complete text of millions  of older books and periodicals that are out of copyright, including  very rare ones.  Especially for 18th- and 19th-century topics,  it may provide access to material owned by only a few major research  libraries.  As with the databases of articles scanned from periodicals,  the fact that you are able to read it as a Google Book is not important.   In a note or a bibliography, you give only the information any reader  will need to locate it anywhere &#8211; author, title, original publisher,  place of publication, and date.  Look for the title page and copyright  page, just as you would if you were using a print copy.    
		</p><p><strong>Google Images</strong> also may  be helpful, although the way Google ranks what it finds means that you  are as likely to get a picture from someone's blog about a trip to Europe  as a good picture of a work of art.  If you are working on a particular  artist or a particular subject represented in art, you often will be  better off starting with <strong><a href="http://www.artcyclopedia.com">www.artcyclopedia.com</a></strong>, which provides  links to many different sources of reproductions, including museum websites  and commercial databases.  Another major repository of reproductions  of works of art is <strong>ARTSTOR</strong>, which is a subscriber-only database.  Because of copyright restrictions, reproductions of modern art are much  harder to find.  For them, the best way to begin is to do a Google  search or check <strong><a href="http://www.artchive.com">www.artchive.com</a></strong>. <br />
		</p><p>8.  Despite all of the  many resources available online, it is  <em>extremely unlikely </em>that you will be able to write a good  art historical research paper without using printed sources. Scholarly  books, especially those published by university presses, and major exhibition  catalogues synthesize large amounts of information, sometimes gathered  over years of research in multiple places and languages.  If you  have access to subscriber-only databases, then you probably will have  access to <strong><em>WorldCat</em></strong>, which is a union catalogue that lists   the holdings of hundreds of libraries. Most publications can be obtained  through Interlibrary Loan.  Or you can start with the catalogue  of the best library you have access to.  If you know the names  of the publications you want, or you have a list of names of authors  who have written on the topic, you can search for them directly.   You also should do a general search for your topic.  Remember that  there is a difference between doing a search using &quot;keyword&quot;  and &quot;subject&quot; (see above, 2).   <br />
		</p><p>9.  You should try to  find much more material than you need, since not all of it will be useful.   First, you must separate the reliable sources from the unreliable, and  the ones you have access to from the ones you will not be able to see  or, in the case of foreign languages, understand.  That still may  leave many sources, and you will have to decide where to start.   A recent general introduction to the topic or perhaps <strong><em>the textbook  for your course </em></strong>might allow you to figure out what you  need next.  Sometimes a book review is helpful.  A review  in the periodical <em>Art Bulletin</em>, for example, usually surveys  all of the relevant scholarly literature on the subject before getting  to the book being reviewed.  This type of review offers a quick  way to get at least one scholar’s opinion of what is useful and what  isn’t. <br />
		</p>
		<p>10.  Note that an <strong>annotated  bibliography</strong> is DIFFERENT from the <strong>bibliography</strong> that comes  at the end of your paper.  The first consists of complete references  to the sources you found, cited in the proper form for a bibliography,  as well as a summary of the contents of each one.  The reader should be told what is in the source and how it might be useful  for your research topic.  An account of a work written by its maker,  for example, will be interesting in a different way from a factual historical  account of its creation written by an art historian.  It is not  that one is true and one is false (although that also might be the case),  but that the points of view and purposes of the two writers are entirely  different.  Some sources might be useful for illustrations, and  another because an excellent index allows you to find the information  you need quickly.  Perhaps the bibliography is exceptionally complete.   The more specific your description is, the more helpful the annotations  will be to the reader.  </p><p>  </p><p class="mod"><a href="appendix3.html"><strong>Appendix II</strong></a> provides  correct citation forms for both notes and bibliography according to  the Humanities version of the Chicago Manual Style.  <strong>Appendix  III</strong> includes sample visual descriptions by students, with suggested edits and revisions by me. <strong>Appendix IV</strong> consists of an explanation of all the steps involved in the production of an actual student's  research paper, from selecting a topic, finding sources, and taking notes, to writing and revision of the final paper.</p>
