		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p class="mod"> This  text is intended to help students improve their ability to write about visual  things.  I explain the most common types  of analysis used by art historians and a little bit about how these methods  developed.  This is not a history of art  history, however, nor is it an introduction to the theory and methods of art  history.  Major scholars are not  mentioned and complicated ideas have been presented only in terms relevant to their practical application.  It also is  not a guide to learning how to look at art.   For that, Joshua Taylor’s <em>Learning to Look</em> remains unsurpassed.<a href="notes.html#n3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
		<p> Almost all of my examples come from  texts written in English.  Translations  change exactly what is of greatest interest here: the words and concepts used  by good writers about art. Furthermore, there is a history to the language used  in English by art historians.  Sometimes  this has shaped the meaning of a term, occasionally in significant ways.  A few examples will be discussed below.  Even in their use of ordinary words, however,  these writers can serve as models.  Their  vocabulary and ideas offer a wealth of contributions to the internal resources  upon which we all draw when we write.   The more developed these resources are, the more fluent and expressive  writing based upon them will be.</p>
		<p> Painting, sculpture, and  architecture have been considered the major forms of the fine arts during much  of the Western tradition.  They have  attracted many of the most ambitious artists and, consequently, more attention  from art historians.  Architecture,  however, like video and electronic mediums, requires a specialized descriptive  and analytical vocabulary.  Just as the  art historical methods I explain are the ones most commonly used, so the forms  of art discussed in the passages I have selected are those most frequently  covered in art history courses.  For the  same reason, most of the art analyzed in the text comes from the West.</p>
		<p> I have not included any  reproductions, in the hope that more attention will be given to the passages  quoted.  Glancing at a picture and then  skimming text about it is not the same as trying to create a mental image of  something from words alone.  The absence  of illustrations also should make it easier for each reader to decide which  words seem particularly effective in communicating information about visual  things.  However, I have given enough  information about each work so that a picture of it can be found without difficulty. Many of them will be familiar from art history surveys.</p>
		<p> Another editorial decision I made  was to cite the names of the authors quoted within my text.  The normal practice of putting that  information in the notes makes it easier for the reader, who is given a  smoothly flowing argument instead of one constantly interrupted by names and  book titles.  Here, however, since my  subject is writing, identifying the writer with the passage seemed useful.  The most important art historians of the past  have birth and death dates in parentheses after the first mention of their  names.</p>
		<p> This is a guide to writing about art, not to  writing itself.  It is no substitute for  a book like <em>The Elements of Style</em>, the classic but still inspiring text  by William Strunk, Jr. and E.B. White.<a href="notes.html#n4"><sup>4</sup></a> Nonetheless, I would like to begin with a few fundamental principles.  Paragraphs should be the basic organizing  unit of any essay.  Each one should  develop a single idea, introduced at the beginning of the paragraph by a topic  sentence.  The paragraphs should be  organized so that the ideas follow one another in a logical sequence. This  means that the topic sentences should form an outline of what the writer  intends to express.  Sentences should be  complete, and grammar and spelling must be correct.  Words should convey the writer’s meaning as  directly as possible.</p>
		<p> The choice of which verb tenses to  use must be consistent throughout a single piece of writing.  My personal choice is to use the present  tense for anything that still exists, like a work of art or a book, and the  past tense for a completed action.  In  other words, Michelangelo sculpted <em>David</em> (because he did it centuries  ago), but <em>David</em> shows Michelangelo's interest in the Classical  conception of the nude male body (because it still does).  This seems to me the most logical approach,  although sometimes it leads to awkward phrasing.  Many people use the present tense for both  cases.  In other words, Michelangelo uses  the Classical conception of the nude male body in his sculpture <em>David</em>.  Whatever the choice, it must be adhered to  throughout any particular essay.</p>
		<p> To be effective, a paper must be  directed toward a single goal.  The  purpose matters to the writer and it matters to the reader, who will have  expectations about what comes next based on what has been promised.  Writing intended to evoke a vivid impression  of a work of art has to present very different information from an  interpretation of the subject that depends upon detailed historical  arguments.  For this reason, it is  important to let the reader know as soon as possible what kind of analysis will  follow.  Every aspect of the paper should  contribute to it.</p>
		<p> Success is measured by how well the  intended meaning has been communicated to the intended reader.  There is no substitute for having someone  read a draft, or for putting a paper aside and returning to revise it later.  Even before that, though, a writer should try  to assess the clarity and logic of the presentation.  Underlining topic sentences to see if they  really do outline the argument is helpful. Quickly sketching elements mentioned  in a visual description is another revealing exercise. If there is no place in  the drawing for a particular detail, it has been introduced at the wrong point  in the essay or essential elements have been neglected. Most of all, the writer  should be prepared to revise and revise and revise.  Good papers never just happen.</p>
