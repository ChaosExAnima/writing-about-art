				<h3>Formal Analysis</h3>
				<p class="mod"> Formal analysis is a specific type of visual description. Unlike ekphrasis, it is not
					meant to evoke the work in the reader’s mind. Instead it is an explanation of visual structure, of
					the ways in which certain visual elements have been arranged and function within a composition.
					Strictly speaking, subject is not considered and neither is historical or cultural context. The
					purest formal analysis is limited to what the viewer sees. Because it explains how the eye is led
					through a work, this kind of description provides a solid foundation for other types of analysis. It
					is always a useful exercise, even when it is not intended as an end in itself.</p>
				<p> The British art critic Roger Fry (1866-1934) played an important role in developing the language of
					formal analysis we use in English today. Inspired by modern art, Fry set out to escape the
					interpretative writing of Victorians like Ruskin. He wanted to describe what the viewer saw,
					independent of the subject of the work or its emotional impact. Relying in part upon late 19th- and
					early 20th-century studies of visual perception, Fry hoped to bring scientific rigor to the analysis
					of art. If all viewers responded to visual stimuli in the same way, he reasoned, then the essential
					features of a viewer’s response to a work could be analyzed in absolute &ndash; rather than
					subjective or interpretative &ndash; terms. This approach reflected Fry’s study of the natural
					sciences as an undergraduate. Even more important were his studies as a painter, which made him
					especially aware of the importance of how things had been made.<a
						href="notes.html#n17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
				<p> The idea of analyzing a single work of art, especially a painting, in terms of specific visual
					components was not new. One of the most influential systems was created by the 17th-century French
					Academician Roger de Piles (1635-1709). His book, <em>The Principles of Painting</em>, became very
					popular throughout Europe and appeared in many languages. An 18th-century English edition translates
					de Piles’s terms of analysis as: composition (made up of invention and disposition or design),
					drawing, color, and expression. These ideas and, even more, these words, gained additional fame in
					the English-speaking world when the painter and art critic Jonathan Richardson (1665-1745) included
					a version of de Piles’s system in a popular guide to Italy. Intended for travelers, Richardson’s
					book was read by everyone who was interested in art. In this way, de Piles’s terms entered into the
					mainstream of discussions about art in English.<a href="notes.html#n18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
				<p> Like de Piles’s system, Roger Fry’s method of analysis breaks a work of art into component parts,
					but they are different ones. The key elements are (in Joshua Taylor’s explanation):</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p> <em>Color</em>, both as establishing a general key and as setting up a relationship of parts;
						<em>line</em>, both as creating a sense of structure and as embodying movement and character;
						<em>light and dark</em>, which created expressive forms and patterns at the same time as it
						suggested the character of volumes through light and shade; the sense of <em>volume</em> itself
						and what might be called <em>mass</em> as contrasted with space; and the concept of
						<em>plane</em>, which was necessary in discussing the organization of space, both in depth and
						in a two-dimensional pattern. Towering over all these individual elements was the
						<em>composition</em>, how part related to part and to whole: composition not as an arbitrary
						scheme of organization but as a dominant contributor to the expressive content of the
						painting.<a href="notes.html#n19"><sup>19</sup></a>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="mod"> Fry first outlined his analytical approach in 1909, published in an article which was
					reprinted in 1920 in his book <em>Vision and Design</em>.<a href="notes.html#n20"><sup>20</sup></a>
				</p>
				<p> Some of the most famous examples of Fry's own analyses appear in <em>C&eacute;zanne. A Study of His
						Development</em>.<a href="notes.html#n21"><sup>21</sup></a> Published in 1927, the book was
					intended to persuade readers that C&eacute;zanne was one of the great masters of Western art long
					before that was a generally accepted point of view. Fry made his argument through careful study of
					individual paintings, many in private collections and almost all of them unfamiliar to his readers.
					Although the book included reproductions of the works, they were small black-and-white
					illustrations, murky in tone and detail, which conveyed only the most approximate idea of the
					pictures. Furthermore, Fry warned his readers, “it must always be kept in mind that such [written]
					analysis halts before the ultimate concrete reality of the work of art, and perhaps in proportion to
					the greatness of the work it must leave untouched a greater part of the objective.”<a
						href="notes.html#n22"><sup>22</sup></a> In other words, the greater the work, the less it can be
					explained in writing. Nonetheless, he set out to make his case with words.</p>
				<p> One of the key paintings in Fry’s book is C&eacute;zanne’s <em>Still-life with Compotier</em>
					(Private collection, Paris), painted about 1880. The lengthy analysis of the picture begins with a
					description of the application of paint. This was, Fry felt, the necessary place of beginning
					because all that we see and feel ultimately comes from paint applied to a surface. He wrote:
					“Instead of those brave swashing strokes of the brush or palette knife [that C&eacute;zanne had used
					earlier], we find him here proceeding by the accumulation of small touches of a full brush.”<a
						href="notes.html#n23"><sup>23</sup></a> This single sentence vividly outlines two ways
					C&eacute;zanne applied paint to his canvas (“brave, swashing strokes” versus “small touches”) and
					the specific tools he used (brush and palette knife). As is often the case in Fry’s writing, the
					words he chose go beyond what the viewer sees to suggest the process of painting, an explanation of
					the surface in terms of the movement of the painter’s hand. </p>
				<p> After a digression about how other artists handled paint, Fry returned to <em>Still-life with
						Compotier</em>. He rephrased what he had said before, integrating it with a fuller description
					of C&eacute;zanne’s technique:</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p> [C&eacute;zanne] has abandoned altogether the sweep of a broad brush, and builds up his masses
						by a succession of hatched strokes with a small brush. These strokes are strictly parallel,
						almost entirely rectilinear, and slant from right to left as they descend. And this direction of
						the brush strokes is carried through without regard to the contours of the objects.<a
							href="notes.html#n24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="mod"> From these three sentences, the reader gathers enough information to visualize the
					surface of the work. The size of the strokes, their shape, the direction they take on the canvas,
					and how they relate to the forms they create are all explained. Already the painting seems very
					specific. On the other hand, the reader has not been given the most basic facts about what the
					picture represents. For Fry, that information only came after everything else, if it was mentioned
					at all.</p>
				<p> Then Fry turned to “the organization of the forms and the ordering of the volumes.” Three of the
					objects in the still-life are mentioned, but only as aspects of the composition.</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p> Each form seems to have a surprising amplitude, to permit of our apprehending it with an ease
						which surprises us, and yet they admit a free circulation in the surrounding space. It is above
						all the main directions given by the rectilinear lines of the napkin and the knife that make us
						feel so vividly this horizontal extension [of space]. And this horizontal [visually] supports
						the spherical volumes, which enforce, far more than real apples could, the sense of their
						density and mass.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="mod"> He continued in a new paragraph:</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p> One notes how few the forms are. How the sphere is repeated again and again in varied
						quantities. To this is added the rounded oblong shapes which are repeated in two very distinct
						quantities in the compotier and the glass. If we add the continually repeated right lines [of
						the brush strokes] and the frequently repeated but identical forms of the leaves on the
						wallpaper, we have exhausted this short catalogue. The variation of quantities of these forms is
						arranged to give points of clear predominance to the compotier itself to the left, and the
						larger apples to the right centre. One divines, in fact, that the forms are held together by
						some strict harmonic principle almost like that of the canon in Greek architecture, and that it
						is this that gives its extraordinary repose and equilibrium to the whole design.<a
							href="notes.html#n25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="mod"> Finally the objects in the still-life have come into view: a compotier (or fruit dish),
					a glass, apples, and a knife, arranged on a cloth and set before patterned wallpaper. </p>
				<p> In Fry’s view of C&eacute;zanne, contour, or the edges of forms, are especially important. The
					Impressionists, C&eacute;zanne's peers and exact contemporaries, were preoccupied “by the continuity
					of the visual welt.” For C&eacute;zanne, on the other hand, contour </p>
				<blockquote>
					<p> became an obsession. We find the traces of this throughout this still-life. He actually draws
						the contour with his brush, generally in a bluish grey. Naturally the curvature of this line is
						sharply contrasted with his parallel hatchings, and arrests the eye too much. He then returns
						upon it incessantly by repeated hatchings which gradually heap up round the contour to a great
						thickness. The contour is continually being lost and then recovered .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [which]
						naturally lends a certain heaviness, almost clumsiness, to the effect; but it ends by giving to
						the forms that impressive solidity and weight which we have noticed.<a
							href="notes.html#n26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p> Fry ended his analysis with the shapes, conceived in three dimensions (“volumes”) and in two
					dimensions (“contours”): </p>
				<blockquote>
					<p> At first sight the volumes and contours declare themselves boldly to the eye. They are of a
						surprising simplicity, and are clearly apprehended. But the more one looks the more they elude
						any precise definition. The apparent continuity of the contour is illusory, for it changes in
						quality throughout each particle of its length. There is no uniformity in the tracing of the
						smallest curve.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We thus get at once the notion of extreme simplicity in the
						general result and of infinite variety in every part. It is this infinitely changing quality of
						the very stuff of painting which communicates so vivid a sense of life. In spite of the
						austerity of the forms, all is vibration and movement.<a href="notes.html#n27"><sup>27</sup></a>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p> Fry wrote with a missionary fervor, intent upon persuading readers of his point of view. In this
					respect, his writings resemble Ruskin’s, although Fry replaced Ruskin’s rich and complicated
					language with clear, spare words about paint and composition. A text by Fry like the one above
					provides the reader with tangible details about the way a specific picture looks, whereas Ruskin’s
					text supplies an interpretation of its subject. Of course, different approaches may be inspired by
					the works themselves. Ignoring the subject is much easier if the picture represents a grouping of
					ordinary objects than if it shows a dramatic scene of storm and death at sea. The fact that Fry
					believed in C&eacute;zanne’s art so deeply says something about what he believed was important in
					art. It also says something about the taste of the modern period, just as Ruskin’s values and style
					of writing reveal things about the Victorian period. Nonetheless, anyone can learn a great deal from
					reading either of them. </p>
				<p> Ellen Johnson, an art historian and art critic who wrote extensively about modern art, often used
					formal analysis. One example is a long description of Richard Diebenkorn's <em>Woman by a Large
						Window</em> (Allen Art Museum, Oberlin), which covers the arrangement of shapes into a
					composition, the application of paint, the colors, and finally the mood of the work. Although
					organized in a different order from Fry's analysis of Cézanne's still-life, her discussion defines
					the painting in similar terms.</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p> [Diebenkorn's] particular way of forming the picture .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is captivating,
						.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. organizing the picture plane into large, relatively open areas interrupted by a
						greater concentration of activity, a spilling of shapes and colors asymmetrically placed on one
						side of the picture.  In <em>Woman by a Large Window</em> the asymmetry of the painting is
						further enhanced by having the figure not only placed at the left of the picture but, more
						daringly, facing directly out of the picture. This leftward direction and placement is brought
						into a precarious and exciting but beautifully controlled balance by the mirror on the right
						which .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. creates a fascinating ambiguity and enrichment of the picture space.</p>
					<p class="mod"> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The interior of the room and the woman in it are painted in
						subdued, desert-sand colors, roughly and vigorously applied with much of the drawing achieved by
						leaving exposed an earlier layer of paint. The edges of the window, table and chair, and the
						contours of the figure, not to mention the purple eye, were drawn in this way. In other areas,
						the top layer, roughly applied as though with a scrub brush, is sufficiently thin to permit the
						under-color to show through and vary the surface hue. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [T]he landscape is more
						positive in hue and value contrasts and the paint more thick and rich.  The bright apple-green
						of the fields and the very dark green of the trees are enlivened by smaller areas of orange,
						yellow and purple; the sky is intensely blue.  The glowing landscape takes on added sparkle by
						contrast with the muted interior .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  Pictorially, however, [the woman] is
						anchored to the landscape by the dark of her hair forming one value and shape with the trees
						behind her.  This union of in and out, of near and far, repeated in the mirror image, emphasizes
						the plane of the picture, the two-dimensional character of which is
						further asserted by the planar organization into four horizontal divisions: floor, ledge,
						landscape and sky.  Thus, while the distance of the landscape is firmly stated, it is just as
						firmly denied .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
					<p class="mod">While the mood of the picture is conveyed most obviously through the position and
						attitude of the figure, still the entire painting functions in evoking this response
						.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Lonely but composed, withdrawn from but related to her environment, the woman
						reminds one of the self-contained, quiet and melancholy figures on Greek funerary reliefs.  Like
						them, relaxed and still, she seems to have sat for centuries.<a
							href="notes.html#n28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p> Johnson’s description touches on all aspects of what the viewer sees before ending with a final
					paragraph about mood. Firmly situated in our understanding of specific physical and visual aspects
					of Diebenkorn’s painting, her analogy to the seated women on Greek funerary reliefs enhances our
					ability to envision the position and spirit of this woman. It makes the picture seem vivid by
					referring to something entirely other. The image also is unexpected, so the description ends with an
					idea that catches our attention because it is new, while simultaneously summarizing an important
					part of her analysis. An allusion must work perfectly to be useful, however. Otherwise it becomes a
					distraction, a red herring that leads the reader away from the subject at hand.</p>
				<p> The formal analysis of works other than paintings needs different words. In <em>Learning to
						Look</em>, Joshua Taylor identified three key elements that determine much of our response to
					works of sculpture. The artist “creates not only an object of a certain size and weight but also a
					space that we experience in a specific way.” A comparison between an Egyptian seated figure (Louvre,
					Paris) and Giovanni da Bologna’s <em>Mercury </em>(National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC) reveals
					two very different treatments of form and space:</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p> The Egyptian sculptor, cutting into a block of stone, has shaped and organized the parts of his
						work so that they produce a particular sense of order, a unique and expressive total form. The
						individual parts have been conceived of as planes which define the figure by creating a movement
						from one part to another, a movement that depends on our responding to each new change in
						direction. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In this process our sense of the third-dimensional aspect of the work
						is enforced and we become conscious of the work as a whole. The movement within the figure is
						very slight, and our impression is one of solidity, compactness, and immobility. </p>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="mod"> In <em>Mercury</em>, on the other hand, “the movement is active and rapid.”</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p> The sculptor’s medium has encouraged him to create a free movement around the figure and out
						into the space in which the figure is seen. This space becomes an active part of the
						composition. We are conscious not only of the actual space displaced by the figure, as in the
						former piece, but also of the space seeming to emanate from the figure of Mercury. The
						importance of this expanding space for the statue may be illustrated if we imagine this figure
						placed in a narrow niche. Although it might fit physically, its rhythms would seem truncated,
						and it would suffer considerably as a work of art. The Egyptian sculpture might not demand so
						particular a space setting, but it would clearly suffer in assuming Mercury’s place as the
						center piece of a splashing fountain.<a href="notes.html#n29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p> Rudolf Arnheim (1904-2007) also used formal analysis, but as it relates to the process of perception
					and psychology, specifically Gestalt psychology, which he studied in Berlin during the 1920s. Less
					concerned with aesthetic qualities than the authors quoted above, he was more rigorous in his study
					of shapes, volumes, and composition. In his best-known book,<em> Art and Visual Perception. A
						Psychology of the Creative Eye</em>, first published in 1954, Arnheim analyzed, in order:
					balance, shape, form, growth, space, light, color, movement, tension, and expression.<a
						href="notes.html#n30"><sup>30</sup></a> Many of the examples given in the text are works of art,
					but he made it clear that the basic principles relate to any kind of visual experience. In other
					books, notably <em>Visual Thinking and the Power of the Center: A Study of Composition in the Visual
						Arts</em>, Arnheim developed the idea that visual perception is itself a kind of thought.<a
						href="notes.html#n31"><sup>31</sup></a> Seeing and comprehending what has been seen are two
					different aspects of the same mental process. This was not a new idea, but he explored it in
					relation to many specific visual examples.</p>
				<p> Arnheim began with the assumption that any work of art is a composition before it is anything else:
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p> When the eyes meet a particular picture for the first time, they are faced with the challenge of
						the new situation: they have to orient themselves, they have to find a structure that will lead
						the mind to the picture’s meaning. If the picture is representational, the first task is to
						understand the subject matter. But the subject matter is dependent on the form, the arrangement
						of the shapes and colors, which appears in its pure state in “abstract,” non-mimetic works.<a
							href="notes.html#n32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="mod"> To explain how different uses of a central axis alter compositional structure, for
					example, Arnheim compared El Greco’s <em>Expulsion from the Temple</em> (Frick Collection, New York)
					to Fra Angelico’s <em>Annunciation</em> (San Marco, Florence). About the first, Arnheim wrote:</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p> The central object reposes in stillness even when within itself it expresses strong action. The
						Christ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is a typical <em>figura serpentinata</em> [spiral figure]. He chastises
						the merchant with a decisive swing of the right arm, which forces the entire body into a twist.
						The figure as a whole, however, is firmly anchored in the center of the painting, which raises
						the event beyond the level of a passing episode. Although entangled with the temple crowd,
						Christ is a stable axis around which the noisy happening churns.<a
							href="notes.html#n33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="mod"> Although his discussion identifies the forms in terms of subject, Arnheim’s only concern
					is the way the composition works around its center. The same is true in his discussion of Fra
					Angelico’s fresco:</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p> As soon as we split the compositional space down the middle, its structure changes. It now
						consists of two halves, each organized around its own center.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Appropriate
						compositional features must bridge the boundary. Fra Angelico’s <em>Annunciation </em>at San
						Marco, for example, is subdivided by a prominent frontal column, which distinguishes the
						celestial realm of the angel from the earthly realm of the Virgin. But the division is countered
						by the continuity of the space behind the column. The space is momentarily covered but not
						interrupted by the vertical in the foreground. The lively interaction between the messenger and
						recipient also helps bridge the separation.<a href="notes.html#n34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>All formal analysis identifies specific visual elements and discusses how they work together.  If the
					goal of a writer is to explain how parts combine to create a whole, and what effect that whole has
					on the viewer, then this type of analysis is essential.  It also can be used to define visual
					characteristics shared by a number of objects.  When the similarities seem strong enough to set a
					group of objects apart from others, they can be said to define a &quot;style.&quot;  Stylistic
					analysis can be applied to everything from works made during a single period by a single individual
					to a survey of objects made over centuries.  All art historians use it.</p>
