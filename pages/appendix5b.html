							>The Endymion Sarcophagus (47.100.4) is a Roman
							marble sarcophagus created between 200-220 CE during
							the Severan Dynasty, decorated with scenes dealing
							with love and immortality</span
						>.  The base of the sarcophagus is 73 inches wide by 20
						inches tall, with the top an additional eight inches
						high.  The shape of the sarcophagus is known as
						<em>lenos</em>, which resembles a trough for pressing
						grapes.<a
							href="#_ftn1"
							name="_ftnref1"
							title=""
							id="_ftnref1"
							><sup>1</sup></a
						>  The heavily decorated sarcophagus depicts many
						figures in a deeply undercut relief.  It was found at
						Ostia in 1825, but then lost until 1913, and was bought
						by the Metropolitan Museum of art at 1947.<a

					</p>
					<p class="mod">
						<span style="text-decoration: underline"
							>The sarcophagus has decorations on both the base
							and lid</span
						>.  The major carvings are on the long sides.  The
						front, distinguished by the depth of the carving, shows
						the main myth of Selene and Endymion bracketed on either
						side by a large lions' head.  The back shows a pastoral
						scene in a lower relief.  The low reliefs on the back
						are to let it sit flush against the wall of a vault. 
						The sides have depictions of Selene and Helios.  The lid
						of the sarcophagus is bare except for the front, which
						is ornamented with a panel with an inscription in the
						center, and ten small scenes in arches on either side.
					</p>
					<p class="mod">
						<span style="text-decoration: underline"
							>The central myth depicted on the sarcophagus is
							that of Selene and Endymion</span
						>.  The Greek goddess Selene represents the moon, and is
						the sister of Helios, the sun god.  Selene fell in love
						with Endymion, a beautiful young huntsman or shepherd. 
						She came to him while he was asleep in a grotto and put
						him into an eternal sleep.<a
							href="#_ftn3"
							name="_ftnref3"
							title=""
							id="_ftnref3"
							><sup>3</sup></a
						>  This event supposedly took place on Mount Latmos,
						near Miletos.  The main scene on the front of the
						sarcophagus illustrates Selene meeting Endymion while he
						sleeps.  Because of cupids holding torches and Selene
						riding her chariot, the scene is set in the nighttime. 
						One of the small scenes on the lid of the sarcophagus
						shows Endymion having awoken to be with Selene.  To the
						right of the scene, Selene is mounting her chariot after
						the meeting with Endymion.
					</p>
					<p class="mod">
						<span style="text-decoration: underline"
							>The front consists of many figures arranged between
							two matching lions' heads</span
						>.  Despite the complexity of the design, the major
						characters are easily identifiable.  On the front of the
						base, near the center is a woman that is around one and
						a half feet tall.  She is the goddess Selene, stepping
						down from a chariot pulled by two rearing horses located
						to her left.<a
							href="#_ftn4"
							name="_ftnref4"
							title=""
							id="_ftnref4"
							><sup>4</sup></a
						>  She wears a flowing dress that leaves her right
						breast uncovered.  She holds a veil above her head that
						forms a crescent moon shape, and holds a wreath in her
						right hand.  She is depicted from the side, leaning over
						a man to the right.

					<p class="mod">

						is slightly smaller than Selene is.  She holds the reins
						of the horses in her right hand and a whip in the left,
						attempting to calm the horses down.  Sitting on the
						ground to directly to her left is a bearded shepherd who
						is scratching a dog.  Around him lay several sheep.  On
						both the left and right of the figures are two large
						lion heads with their mouths open.  They are placed in a
						place where the spouts are found on grape pressing
						troughs upon which the shape of the sarcophagus is

						three grazing horses.  On the right stand a herdsman and

						stand near Helios, with one pointing to the scene on the

						<strong><em>Comments:</em></strong> Compare the outline
						of topic sentences to the outline of the paper.  Do they
						match?  Note how the outline separates the physical
						description from the identification of the figures.  The
						topic sentences, on the other hand, seem to mix the
						two.  The paper moves from the &quot;central myth&quot;
						to &quot;front,&quot; but isn't the central myth on the
						front?  Then it moves to Endymion, but isn't he part of
						the &quot;central myth&quot;?  This confusion continues,
						and some, but not all, of the arched panels along the
						top of the front, have an individual paragraph.  In the
						last section, discussion of Endymion sarcophagi seems to
						be split.  The paper apparently ends with the fact that
						this example was made in Rome, which seems like new
						information rather than a conclusion.  Note that none of
						the topic sentences relates to the theme of sleep and
						death, which is an entire section in the outline.  The
						conclusion there follows naturally - why was the theme
						popular?

					<p>
						<strong><em>Paragraph 1</em>:</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span style="text-decoration: underline"
							>The Endymion Sarcophagus (47.100.4) is a Roman
							marble sarcophagus created between 200-220 CE during
							the Severan Dynasty, decorated with scenes dealing
							with love and immortality</span
						>. [<em
							>This is a little long for the first sentence of a
							paper, and contains some repetition.  The word
							sarcophagus is used twice, and Roman, the dates, and
							Severan are different ways of referring to the same
							period of time. Furthermore, if the paper will be
							about the carved scenes, it would be better to
							condense the facts and make the last part of the
							sentence come after the verb</em
						>.]  The base of the sarcophagus is 73 inches wide by 20
						inches tall, with the top an additional eight inches
						high.  [<em
							>Top is vague - is this part of the body of the
							sarcophagus or a lid?</em
						>] The shape of the sarcophagus is known as
						<em>lenos</em>, which resembles a trough for pressing
						grapes.  [<em
							>Since a modern reader has no idea what a trough for
							pressing grapes looks like, or why it is relevant,
							another description of the shape would be
							helpful.</em
						>]  The heavily decorated sarcophagus depicts many
						figures in a deeply undercut relief.  [<em
							>This relates to the last part of the first sentence
							rather than the physical facts that precede it. 
							Perhaps the order should be changed.</em
						>]  It was found at Ostia in 1825, but then lost until
						1913, and was bought by the Metropolitan Museum of art
						at 1947.  [<em
							>Where is Ostia, what was the context in which it
							was found, and why does it matter that it was lost? 
							The &quot;a&quot; of &quot;art&quot; is part of the
							proper name of the museum and should be
							capitalized.]</em
						>
					</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>
						<strong><em>Paragraph 2:</em></strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span style="text-decoration: underline"
							>The sarcophagus has decorations on both the base
							and lid</span
						>.  [<em
							>This is the first mention of a lid (called
							&quot;top&quot; above), and the information is basic
							enough to be part of the first paragraph.</em
						>]  The major carvings are on the long sides.  [<em
							>It wasn't clear from the first paragraph that the
							sarcophagus has long sides and - presumably - short
							sides.  This also should be established in the first
							paragraph</em
						>.]  The front, distinguished by the depth of the
						carving, shows the main myth of Selene and Endymion
						bracketed on either side by a large lions' head.  [<em
							>The main myth, which apparently gives the
							sarcophagus its name, should be mentioned in the
							first paragraph.  The use of depth of carving is
							confusing - does this mean that the front is
							different from all the other sides? If head is
							singular (&quot;a&quot;), it should be a
							&quot;lion's&quot; head.</em
						>]  The back shows a pastoral scene in a lower relief. 
						[<em
							>&quot;Lower&quot; than what?  It also would be more
							graceful to say that it was or is carved in lower
							relief.</em
						>]  The low reliefs on the back are to let it sit flush
						against the wall of a vault.  [<em
							>Now the reliefs are plural, when the previous
							sentence mentions only one scene, the reference for
							&quot;it&quot; is not clear, and there has been no
							mention of a vault.  What is it, how do we know
							about it, and does this mean that any sarcophagus
							carved in low relief was meant to stand against a
							wall?</em
						>] The sides have depictions of Selene and Helios.  [<em
							>Each side depicts Selene and Helios, or one side
							depicts one and the other, the other?</em
						>] The lid of the sarcophagus is bare except for the
						front, which is ornamented with a panel with an
						inscription in the center, and ten small scenes in
						arches on either side. [<em
							>Again, the lid should be mentioned in the first
							paragraph, and the ten arched scenes amount to a
							total of ten, five on each side, or a total of
							twenty, ten on each side?</em
						>]
					</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>
						<strong><em>Paragraph 3:</em></strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span style="text-decoration: underline"
							>The central myth depicted on the sarcophagus is
							that of Selene and Endymion</span
						>.  [<em
							>This should have been said in the first paragraph,
							so there will be no need to repeat it here.</em
						>]  The Greek goddess Selene represents the moon, and is
						the sister of Helios, the sun god.  [<em
							>The phrasing is awkward.  Selene doesn't represent
							the moon.  She is the goddess of the moon.</em
						>]  Selene fell in love with Endymion, a beautiful young
						huntsman or shepherd. She came to him while he was
						asleep in a grotto and put him into an eternal sleep. 
						This event supposedly took place on Mount Latmos, near
						Miletos. [<em
							>Unless this place is relevant to what is shown, it
							seems like a fact that is an extra for this paper. 
							Not everything about Selene and Endymion is worth
							mentioning.</em
						>] The main scene on the front of the sarcophagus
						illustrates Selene meeting Endymion while he sleeps. 
						Because of cupids holding torches and Selene riding her
						chariot, the scene is set in the nighttime.  [<em
							>Awkward wording - the scene is not set in the night
							because the cupids hold torches.  Instead, we as
							viewers understand that it takes place at night
							because of the torches and the fact that Selene, the
							goddess of the moon, is out.</em
						>]  One of the small scenes on the lid of the
						sarcophagus shows Endymion having awoken to be with
						Selene.  [<em
							>This comes as a surprise, so it might be more
							effective to mention above that they are shown more
							than once on the sarcophagus.</em
						>] To the right of the scene, Selene is mounting her
						chariot after the meeting with Endymion.  [<em
							>Which scene?</em
						>]
					</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>
						<strong><em>Paragraph 4:</em></strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span style="text-decoration: underline"
							>The front consists of many figures arranged between
							two matching lions' heads</span
						>.  [<em
							>This is a basic description of the organization of
							the major area of carving, so it should have come
							above.</em
						>]  Despite the complexity of the design, the major
						characters are easily identifiable.  [<em
							>Indicating how the composition helps tell the story
							is important, especially when there are as many
							elements are there are here.  So it should be
							explained how they are made noticeable and
							identifiable. The first is about visual aspects,
							while the second is about iconography - which means
							that they probably need to be discussed
							separately.</em
						>]  On the front of the base, near the center is a woman
						that is around one and a half feet tall.  [<em
							>To call the front &quot;the front of the base&quot;
							is confusing - use consistent terms for the sections
							and major elements.  In this case, the actual height
							is not nearly as useful as how high she is in
							relation to the entire scene. There should be a
							comma after &quot;center.&quot;</em
						>]  She is the goddess Selene, stepping down from a
						chariot pulled by two rearing horses located to her
						left.  [<em>Is it to her left or our left?</em>]  She
						wears a flowing dress that leaves her right breast
						uncovered.  She holds a veil above her head that forms a
						crescent moon shape, and holds a wreath in her right
						hand.  She is depicted from the side, leaning over a man
						to the right.  [<em
							>This paragraph is not, in fact, about the topic of
							the topic sentence, but rather it is about Selene. 
							So there should be a new topic sentence.  If she is
							the major figure visually, then it makes sense to
							start with her and make the various aspects of her
							appearance the subject of a single paragraph. The
							sentences should be varied so that each one does not
							begin with &quot;she.&quot;</em
						>]
					</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>
						<strong><em>Paragraph 5:</em></strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span style="text-decoration: underline"
							>The man is Endymion, shown lying on the ground with
							his eyes closed</span
						>. [<em
							>The &quot;the&quot; in &quot;the man&quot; only
							makes sense in relation to the last sentence of the
							previous paragraph.  It is better that topic
							sentences be able to stand alone.</em
						>]  He is mostly nude, with only a cloth partially
						covering his chest.  [<em
							>This is not an adequate description of the cloth,
							and the visual emphasis on his genitals should be
							mentioned, especially since it is a story of
							consummated love.</em
						>]  He has one arm held to his head, in the classical
						Greek position of sleep.  [<em
							>&quot;Held to his head&quot; is not precise
							enough.  No reader could draw his position from that
							description.</em
						>]  Standing above him is a winged female figure dressed
						in a robe that may be the goddess Night, or Nyx. [<em
							>The awkward syntax suggests that it is the robe
							that may be the goddess Night, not the female
							figure.</em
						>]  She is holding poppy flowers in her right arm and
						pouring a potion out of a drinking horn with her left
						hand.  [<em
							>They are not flowers, but the pods from which the
							poppy seeds come</em
						>.] Surrounding the figures are six nude winged cupids
						watching the scene between Selene and Endymion.  Four of
						them hold torches to light Endymion, and two hold the
						reins of Selene’s horses.
					</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>
						<strong><em>Paragraph 6:</em></strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span style="text-decoration: underline"
							>There are many other characters depicted in the
							scene that are not part of the myth</span
						>. [<em
							>&quot;in the scene&quot; is not clear - on the
							front? In this group? It is important to be very
							specific here.</em
						>] To the left of the chariot is a female figure that is
						slightly smaller than Selene is.  She holds the reins of
						the horses in her right hand and a whip in the left,
						attempting to calm the horses down.  [<em
							>If she holds the reins to Selene's horses, she is
							related to Selene and thus the main scene.</em
						>]  Sitting on the ground to directly to her left is a
						bearded shepherd who is scratching a dog.  [<em
							>Shouldn't be a &quot;to&quot; after
							&quot;ground.&quot; The appearance of this shepherd
							in the description is so surprising that his visual
							relationship to the main figures has to be made
							clear, and where is the dog?</em
						>] Around him lay several sheep.  [<em
							>Grammar:  the sheep &quot;lie&quot; not
							&quot;lay.&quot;</em
						>]  On both the left and right of the figures are two
						large lion heads with their mouths open.  [<em
							>&quot;To&quot; instead of &quot;on&quot; is better,
							and if the heads are on the left and right, are
							there a total of two or four?</em
						>]  They are placed in a place where the spouts are
						found on grape pressing troughs upon which the shape of
						the sarcophagus is based. [<em
							>Place shouldn't be used twice, and this fact is
							hard to make sense of - why? Do they have spouts on
							the sarcophagus too?</em
						>]  Under the head of the lion on the left, next to the
						man are two small winged figures embracing one another,
						identified as Cupid and Psyche. [<em
							>It should be &quot;to&quot; the left, and what man?
							If there is a comma after &quot;left,&quot; setting
							off the next phrase, there must be a comma after
							&quot;man&quot; too.</em
						>]
					</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>
						<strong><em>Paragraph 7:</em></strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span style="text-decoration: underline"
							>Beyond the lions, the sides of the sarcophagus
							curve around, containing more figures</span
						>. [<em
							>It isn't that the sides curve, but that the long
							sides curve into the ends.</em
						>] On the left side of the sarcophagus, a nude male
						figure wearing a cloak, identified as Helios, is
						depicted climbing into his chariot, pulled by four
						horses.  [<em
							>Make sure the reader always knows what the frame of
							reference is - here, to the left of what? What
							identifies him as Helios? Does his action have a
							meaning?</em
						>]  The right side of the sarcophagus shows Selene
						again, this time in the process of getting into her
						chariot.  The reins of the two horses that pull the
						chariot are held by a winged female figure. [<em
							>Is this a continuation of the scene on the front? 
							If the sun is on one end and the moon on the other,
							do they refer imply the passage of time?  In
							addition, there are other figures that have not been
							mentioned.</em
						>]
					</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>
						<strong><em>Paragraph 8:</em></strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span style="text-decoration: underline"
							>The back depicts a pastoral scene in a shallower
							relief than the front</span
						>.  [<em
							>&quot;carved in shallower relief than the scenes on
							the front&quot; is more graceful wording, and the
							sides also are carved deeply.  How big are the
							figures in relation to the height of the
							sarcophagus?</em
						>]  On the left, past Selene, sits an older bearded man
						dressed in a robe who looks back at Selene. [<em
							>Which Selene this is should be specified if only to
							remind us, there's no need to repeat her name twice,
							and left from which point of view, because it is not
							the same as the last time &quot;left&quot; was
							used.</em
						>]  Behind him are three large bulls and a sheep.  In
						the center are three grazing horses.  On the right stand
						a herdsman and his dog.  Beyond the man and his dog are
						two women who stand near Helios, with one pointing to
						the scene on the front. [<em
							>An indication of how these figures relate to each
							other in terms of two- and three-dimensional design
							would be helpful.  Are they strung out, do they
							overlap, are they clearly all meant to be in the
							same space?  &quot;Beyond&quot; is especially
							confusing, because it does not refer to either
							dimension unambiguously.</em

					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>
						<strong><em>Paragraph 9:</em></strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span style="text-decoration: underline"
							>On the front of the lid is an inscription that

					</p>
					<p>
						“ANINIA HILARA /   CL ∙ ARRIAE MARI / ∙ INCONPARABILE /
						FECIT ∙ VIXIT ∙ / ANN ∙ L ∙ MEN / ∙ X”.
					</p>
					<p>
						This means that the sarcophagus was created for a
						freedwoman named Claudia Arria, who lived for fifty
						years and ten months.  The daughter of Claudia, Aninia
						Hilaria, dedicated the sarcophagus.  [<em
							>This translation is not quite accurate, according
							the article by Sollabella.  It doesn't say call her
							freedwoman, but mother, and she is
							&quot;inconparabile,&quot; a common flattering
							adjective, perhaps something like the English
							incomparable.</em
						>]  The content of inscription is unusual as it
						indicates that the daughter, not a husband, father, or
						son-in-law paid for the sarcophagus.  [<em
							>What is unusual is the act, not the
							inscription.</em
						>]  In fact, according to Saller and Shaw, funerary
						inscriptions from daughters to mothers make up only
						three percent of all dedications. [<em
							>No need to mention the names of the authors in the

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

						<strong><em>Paragraph 10:</em></strong>

					<p>
						<span style="text-decoration: underline"

							>On either side of the inscription are five arched
							panels, carved in low relief.</em
						>]  The scenes on both the far left and far right depict
						male figures at rest within a pastoral landscape. 
						Moving forward toward the center, the reliefs depict
						cupids with fruits and animals, symbolizing the seasons
						and the bounty of the earth.  [<em
							>&quot;The reliefs next to them&quot; would be
							simpler.</em
						>]  The next panel, the third from the left, depicts
						Cupid and Psyche embracing.  [<em
							>If this is all going to be about the ones on the
							left side, then that should be stated in the topic
							sentence of the paragraph.  Otherwise, the reader
							assumes from the second sentence that the discussion
							will move in toward the center from both the right
							and the left.</em
						>]  Cupid turns away from Psyche, while Psyche pulls his
						chin to face her.  The fourth panel from the left is of
						a man dressed in armor and carrying a spear and shield,
						and faces right.  [<em
							>Better to avoid the verb &quot;to be&quot; as much
							as possible, and instead define the relationship
							exactly - the panel shows, represents, depicts, the
							man.</em

					<p>

							>This portrait is so important that it deserves more

							>This was mentioned above, so the explanation of the

							other mythological figures should follow the one
							about Selene and Endymion.</em
						>]  Cupid is the god of love and son of Venus, goddess
						of love and beauty.  Psyche is an extremely beautiful
						mortal woman, of whom Venus is jealous.  Venus sends
						Cupid to cause Psyche to fall in love with someone ugly,
						but he falls in love himself and takes her away.  Psyche
						accidentally harms Cupid, and then appeals to Venus to

						>]  One example is the sarcophagus of Maconiana
						Severiana made in 210 C.E., which features the same
						undercut relief of the Endymion Sarcophagus, but depicts
						the myth of Ariadnea and Dionysos.  [<em
							>Should be &quot;Ariadne.&quot;  More information
							has to be given about this sarcophagus, at minimum
							where it is located today.  Since the undercut
							relief has not been explained, the similarity is
							hard to follow. If the myth also needs to be
							explained, it may be that the comparison is not
							worth the space it will take to make all the aspects
							clear.</em
						>]This myth has some similarities to the myth Selene and
						Endymion, as it also features a mortal gaining the love
						of a god and gaining immortality.  [<em
							>Repetition of &quot;gain&quot; should be avoided,
							and the one is the result of the other -
							&quot;thereby gaining&quot; or &quot;through that
							love gaining.&quot;</em

						<strong><em>Paragraph 17:</em></strong>

					<p>
						<span style="text-decoration: underline"
							>Dionysos is also depicted on the Triumph of
							Dionysos and Seasons Sarcophagus from 260-270
							C.E</span
						>.  [<em
							>Why is this a separate paragraph?  It follows from
							the previous topic sentence.  Again, at least the
							present location of the sarcophagus should be
							given.</em
						>]  One of the noticeable features of this sarcophagus
						is the depiction of the four Seasons, which is also a
						theme on the Endymion Sarcophagus, albeit not as
						prominently. [<em
							>Like the sarcophagus mentioned above, this one
							needs more discussion to make sense as a
							comparison.  These bare facts don't add much to the
							paper.</em
						>]
					</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>
						<strong><em>Paragraph 18:</em></strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span style="text-decoration: underline"
							>Another marble sarcophagus from around the middle
							of the second century depicts another version of the
							Selene and Endymion myth</span
						>.  [<em
							>Since this one is also in the collection of the
							Metropolitan, and shares many of the same elements,
							a discussion of it in much greater detail would make
							the paper richer.</em
						>]  In this, the emphasis shifts to the pastoral aspects
						of the story.  [<em>&quot;In this&quot; what?  How?</em
						>]
					</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>
						<strong><em>Paragraph 19:</em></strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span style="text-decoration: underline"
							>The Endymion sarcophagus likely was made in a
							workshop based in Rome</span
						>.  [<em
							>It would be better to know why this is so and why
							it matters.</em
						>]  After it was purchased, the inscription was added,
						which is seen in the relatively poor quality compared to
						the rest of the carvings.  [<em
							>&quot;The inscription was added after it was
							purchased&quot; would read more smoothly.  How is
							the quality poor?  This comment should be made more
							specific.</em
						>]  The portrait of the deceased was also finished
						later, as the generalized costume and gesture can be
						made to suit anyone, and tool marks around her head
						indicate the rough form from which the portrait was
						created. [<em
							>Finished later than what? What generalized costume
							and gesture?  The &quot;the&quot; indicates that it
							was explained  before, but it wasn't.  The tool
							marks also have to be explained, since this is the
							first time there has been any mention of the way in
							which the sarcophagus was carved.</em
						>]
					</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>
						<strong><em>Final comments:</em></strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						<em
							>This last paragraph is not a conclusion, which
							should summarize the main points of the paper
							without repeating them.  In fact, the information
							seems so basic that it would have been more
							appropriately mentioned earlier.  Perhaps the end of
							the paper could be about the popularity of the
							subject, as suggested in the Outline.  That would
							remind the reader about the subject and its
							popularity while looking at it in a new way.  One of
							the major omissions is any discussion of how the
							sarcophagus was made, or what the color and surface
							of the marble look like.  More information about
							this would give the reader a better sense of its
							physical presence.  A longer comparison to other
							Endymion sarcophagi also would be interesting, and
							more relevant than references to other sarcophagi
							with mythological subjects.  Note that the paper
							does not include a discussion of the Severan style,
							mentioned in the outline.  It’s a relevant topic,
							but not a necessary one, and if examples were not
							easy to find or describe, eliminating it is
							fine.</em
