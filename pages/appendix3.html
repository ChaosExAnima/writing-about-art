				<h3>APPENDIX II: CITATION FORMS </h3>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p> Any citation must contain all the information the reader needs to find the source.  This consists of
					the categories listed below, with differences as indicated for a book, a journal article, and a
					website.  Once you have the correct information, you must organize it into a specific order.  Most
					art historians use the Humanities version of the Chicago Manual Style.  Other common forms are MLA
					and APA.  <em>Follow whatever instructions you have been given</em>.</p>

				<p><strong> Remember: The correct forms for a note and a bibliographic entry are different. </strong>
				</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>1. Here is an outline of the information you will need for each of your sources.  A summary guide to
					the citation forms used in the Humanities version of the Chicago style follows.</p>

				<p>  </p>
				<p><strong>For all publications:</strong></p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p> Author(s) and/or Editor(s)  First name               MI      Last name</p>
				<p class="mod">(An entry in a bibliography is alphabetized under the title if there is no author.)</p>
				<p>Title (underlined or italicized for a book and put in quotation marks for an article)</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>For a book</strong> (check title page and copyright page):</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Name of Publisher</p>

				<p> City of publication</p>

				<p> Date of publication</p>

				<p> Possible additional information, such as edition, exhibition catalogue (exh. cat.), translator</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>For a journal</strong> (periodical, serial, magazine) <strong>article</strong> (check for
					first page of issue):</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Name of journal</p>

				<p> Volume number</p>

				<p> Year published</p>

				<p> Date or number of issue</p>

				<p> Pages on which the article appears</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>For a website</strong>:</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Website name</p>

				<p> Author</p>

				<p> Date posted</p>

				<p> Stable URL (hint: paste the URL into a new browser window and see if it works)</p>

				<p> Date accessed</p><strong><br />
				</strong>
				<p><strong>2.  </strong><strong>Form of notes: </strong></p>

				<p class="mod"> A note, whether a footnote that appears at the bottom of the page of text on which the
					citation occurs, or an endnote that appears at the end of the paper, gives the exact place where you
					found the information you have used at that point in the paper.  Commas, parentheses, or colons
					separate the categories of information, a note always ends with a period, and the first line is
					indented five spaces. The number of the note corresponds to the number given in your text, shown
					either as a number, then a period and two spaces, OR as a superscript number, space.  The numbers
					follow each other sequentially in both the text and the notes.  Even if you use exactly the same
					page in the same source in two different places of your paper, you create a new note for each one,
					numbered in sequence.  </p>

				<p class="mod"> You need not give the complete citation for subsequent references to the same source. 
					Instead use the author's name comma page number period (Taylor, 35.) or, if you have used several
					works by the same author, a shortened title or the date of publication should be added to make it
					clear which one you mean (Taylor, <em>Learning to Look, </em>16. OR  Taylor, 1981, 16.).  Some
					people use the abbreviation <em>ibid. </em>(Latin for <em>ibidem</em>, or &quot;the same
					place&quot;) when the citation has been given in the previous note.  <em>Op. cit.</em> (short for
					&quot;opus citatum&quot;) means the work has been cited previously.  Although either is fine, a
					shortened form is simpler and clearer.</p>
				<p class="mod">&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Note to a book:  </strong></p>

				<p> After the number comes the name of the author (in normal first/last order), comma, the title of the
					publication underlined or italicized, and the place of publication followed by a colon, the
					publisher, and the date of publication in parentheses, If the note takes up more than one line of
					text, the rest is single-spaced and flush with the left margin.  </p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Example of a note to a book:</strong></p>

				<p class="mod"> 3. Joshua C. Taylor, <em>Learning to Look. A Handbook for the Visual Arts</em>, 2nd ed.
					(Chicago and London:  University of Chicago Press, 1981), 16.</p>

				<p>             OR</p>

				<p class="mod"> <sup>3</sup> Joshua C. Taylor, <em>Learning to Look. A Handbook for the Visual
						Arts</em>, 2nd ed. (Chicago and London:  University of Chicago Press, 1981), 16.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Note to an article:  </strong></p>

				<p> After the number comes the name of the author (in normal first/last order), comma, the title of the
					article in quotation marks, the name of the journal underlined or italicized, followed by the
					volume, the year of publication in parentheses, a colon, and the pages that contain the information
					used at this particular point in the text. If the note takes up more than one line of text, the rest
					is single-spaced and flush with the left margin.  </p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Example of a note to an article:</strong></p>

				<p class="mod">4. Robert L. Herbert, “Method and Meaning in Monet,” <em>Art in America</em> 67
					(September 1979): 90.</p>

				<p>             OR</p>

				<p class="mod"> <sup>4</sup> Robert L. Herbert, “Method and Meaning in Monet,” <em>Art in America</em>
					67 (September 1979): 90.</p>

				<p class="mod"><sup>5</sup>Alex Potts,“Winckelmann, Johann Joachim,” in <em>Grove Art Online. Oxford Art
						Online</em>, http://www.oxfordartonline.com (accessed August 22, 2008).</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Note to a website</strong>: </p>
				<p> Check to see if you can find an author, a title for the article, a name for the website, the date
					when it was posted, or anything else that will be useful in identifying the type of site it is. Many
					scholarly sites give this information in citation form somewhere on the homepage, or linked through
					an icon that appears on every screen.  Always put the date you accessed it in parentheses at the end
					of the citation.  </p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Example of a note to an unsigned website:</strong></p>

				<p class="mod"> 6.  &quot;A Scholarly Guide to Google,&quot;
					http://hcl.harvard.edu/research/guides/google/index.html. (Accessed 1/4/09)</p>

					<em>Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History </em>(New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000–),
					http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/arlo/hd_arlo.htm (accessed 1/4/09).</p>
				<p class="mod">&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>3.  Form of an entry in a bibliography: </strong></p>

				<p class="mod"><span style='text-decoration:underline'>Bibliographies are alphabeticized by the last
						name of the author</span>.  If there is no author, the item is alphabeticized under the title,
					ignoring participles such as the, a, or an (for example, the Bible, under &quot;B&quot;). There is a
					period between each category of information. The first line of each entry is flush with the left
					margin, and subsequent lines of the same entry are single-spaced and indented.  If there is more
					than one work by the same author, indent each one and arrange the works alphabetically by title. 
				</p>
				<p class="mod">&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>For a book:</strong></p>

				<p>The last name of the author comes first, followed by the first name, period, the title of the book
					underlined or italicized, period, and the publication information, period.  The name of the author
					and title of a book usually appear on the title page of a book.  The date of publication is the year
					of the copyright, given on the copyright page.  The name of publisher and place of publication
					usually appear on the title page.  They also appear on the copyright page, although the publisher is
					not necessarily what is listed after the copyright symbol.  </p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Example of a bibliographic entry for a book:</strong></p>

				<p class="biblio"> Taylor, Joshua C.  <em>Learning to Look.  A Handbook for the Visual Arts</em>. 2nd
					ed. Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 1981.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Bibliographic entry for an article:</strong></p>

				<p> The last name of the author comes first, then the first name, then a period, followed by the title
					of the article in quotation marks, period, the name of the journal underlined or italicized, the
					volume, the year of publication in parentheses, a colon, and the pages of the article, with a period
					at the end. If the note takes up more than one line of text, the rest is single-spaced and indented
					five spaces.  </p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Example of a bibliographic entry for an article:</strong></p>

				<p> Herbert, Robert L. “Method and Meaning in Monet.” <em>Art in America</em> 67 (September 1979):
					90-108.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Example of a bibliographic entry for an article in <em>Oxford Art Online</em> </strong></p>

				<p> (see &quot;Cite&quot; at the top right of every article)<strong>:</strong></p>

				<p class="biblio"> Potts, Alex. “Winckelmann, Johann Joachim.” In <em>Grove Art Online. Oxford Art
						Online</em>. http://www.oxfordartonline.com (accessed August 22, 2008).</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Bibliographic entry for a website:</strong></p>

				<p> Find as much information as possible, such as the title of the site, the author, and the date it was
					posted. Always include the date you accessed the site.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Example of a bibliographic entry for an unsigned website:</strong></p>

				<p>  &quot;A Scholarly Guide to Google,&quot; http://hcl.harvard.edu/research/guides/google/index.html
					(accessed 1/4/09).</p>

				<p> The article is alphabetized under the title since there is no author.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Example of a bibliographic entry for the <em>Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History</em>:</strong>
				</p>

				<p class="biblio"> Bayer, Andrea. &quot;Art and Love in the Italian Renaissance.&quot; In <em>Heilbrunn
						Timeline of Art History</em>. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000–.
					http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/arlo/hd_arlo.htm (accessed 1/4/09).</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>4.</strong><strong>  Modifications of these forms for special cases.</strong> </p>

				<p> (Examples of almost all of them are in the Notes and Bibliography of <em>Writing about Art</em>).
				</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Book with two or three authors:</strong></p>

				<p> The names are placed in the same order as they are on the title page of the book.  In a note, two
					names are separated with “and” and three names are separated by comma, comma, and “and.”  In a
					bibliographic entry, the name listed first appears with the last name first, but the rest appear in
					their normal order, first then last name.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Book with four or more authors:</strong> </p>

				<p> The name of the first author is followed by the abbreviation “et al.”  There is a period after “al”
					because the word is an abbreviation for the Latin “alii.” The phrase means “and others.”</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Book with an unknown author:</strong> </p>

				<p> The title of the book is used as if it were the name of the author (e.g., the Bible under
					&quot;B&quot;).</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Book with one or more editors as the author:</strong></p>

				<p> The names of the editors are treated as if they were the names of authors, followed by “ed.” or, in
					the case of several, “eds.”</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Book with an author as well as a translator and/or editor:</strong></p>

				<p> The name of the author is given as it would be for any book.  The name of the translator and/or
					editor is given after the title of the book, abbreviated as “trans.” or “ed.” or “trans. and ed.”
				</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Book with more than one volume:</strong></p>

				<p> In notes, the order is: end parentheses after the year of publication, comma, the number of the
					volume, a colon, and then the page number(s).  In a bibliography, the number of volumes (abbreviated
					as “vol.” or “vols.”) follows the title.<strong></strong></p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Revised edition:</strong></p>

				<p> If a book has been revised (not reprinted, but the text actually changed), you must indicate which
					edition you used.  It is put after the title and number of volumes (if there is more than one) as
					“Rev. ed.”<strong>  </strong>If there are several revisions, you must give the number of the one you
					used.<strong></strong></p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Reprint: </strong></p>

				<p> If the book was published a long time ago and you are using a reprint, you should indicate in the
					bibliography that the date of publication is not the same as the one you list.  Add &quot;Orig.
					publ. [date].&quot; before the information about the publisher and date of the reprint, or give the
					date of the original publication, followed by a semi-colon, “rpt.” or “reprint” and then the
					information about the publisher of the book you used.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Standard edition of a book:</strong></p>

				<p> Some books have what is called a standard edition, often with scholarly notes explaining references
					or giving other readings of the text.  If there is such an edition, you should use it when
					possible.  Its text is authoritative and it means that everyone else can find exactly the same words
					you found.  With the Bible, for example, often cited as book, chapter, and verse, the translation
					matters a great deal.  Readers may look up your reference and find different words from the ones you
					quoted.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>One section of a book:</strong></p>

				<p> If you are referring to a section or chapter of a book, the author of that part should be listed as
					the author in your notes and bibliography and the title of the section or chapter put in quotation
					marks, followed by “in” (for notes) or “In” (for a bibliography) the title of the book in which it
					appears.  The author of the book (as opposed to the author of the part you used) appears after the
					title of the book.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Exhibition catalogue:</strong></p>

				<p> Exhibition catalogues should be identified by the abbreviation “Exh. cat.” placed after the title of
					the catalogue.  The author is the name listed on the title page or, if there is none, the name of
					the museum that organized the exhibition, which will be on the copyright page. </p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Article in a popular magazine:</strong></p>

				<p> The specific date of the issue is given after the underlined name of the magazine, in order of day,
					month, year, and then the page number follows after a comma.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Article in a newspaper:</strong></p>

				<p> A newspaper article is treated like an article in a popular magazine, except that the section, if
					there is one, is listed as “sec. [whatever], p. [whatever].”  The page is given with a “p.” so that
					there can be no confusion with the section.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Book review:</strong></p>

				<p> The author of the book review is treated as the author, and the title of the review, put in
					quotation marks, is &quot;Review of [the title of the book reviewed, underlined or italicized], by
					[the name of the author of the book]&quot; and then the publication information in parentheses.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Exhibition review:</strong></p>

				<p> The form is the same as that for a book review.<strong></strong></p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Encyclopedia entry </strong>(including <em>Grove Art Online</em> and <em>Oxford Art
						Online</em>):<strong></strong></p>

				<p> The entry should be alphabeticized under the name of the author, if there is one listed, followed by
					the title of the entry (the heading under which you can find it) in quotation marks, and then the
					name of the encyclopedia with the appropriate publication information.  </p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Internet sources </strong>(including material from the website of the Metropolitan
					Museum)<strong>:</strong></p>

				<p> The author and title of the material should be given if you can find it.  The exact web address for
					the place you found the information must be listed, followed by the date you accessed it in
					parentheses.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Theses and dissertations:</strong></p>

				<p> The name of the author comes first, then<strong> </strong>the title of the thesis or dissertation in
					quotation marks, followed by parentheses Ph period D period diss period comma the name of the
					university which awarded the degree comma year end parentheses period.  For example: (Ph.D. diss.,
					City University of New York, 1998).</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Paper presented at a meeting or a performance:</strong></p>

				<p> The author is the presenter or performer, the title of the paper or performance is given in
					quotation marks, and the particular information about when and where you saw it follows in
					parentheses.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Film or Video:</strong></p>

				<p> The title comes first, underlined or italicized, then as much information about the work as you
					have, with producer abbreviated as prod., director as dir., and minutes as min.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Personal communication:</strong></p>

				<p> The name of the person being cited comes first, then the nature of the communication (e.g., email or
					letter from the author, or conversation with the author), then the date of this communication.</p>
